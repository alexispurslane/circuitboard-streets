You glance down at yourself. You're a tall woman, muscular from a lifetime of habits formed when you were a kid working manual labor. You've always been insecure about your body, having gone through the wrong puberty as a kid, growing more masculine when that was the last thing in the world you wanted, but thanks to your medicine, the last few years have been kinder. You've been slowly growing more feminine, and the more feminine your body gets, the more comfortable you've become. You're almost content with it now.\b A piece of solid industrial iron serves as your right arm, while on your left, 
. As for what you're wearing, it's relatively simple shit for the City: a pair of thick black leather pants, an old faded yellow shirt, steel toed boots, and a micro-shell jacket thrown over top of everything against the cold. 
You are also wearing your active filtration mask.
Your left arm is missing, and just looking at the empty stump where it should be tugs at your psyche as if something is trying to drag you down into insanity. You quell the rising anxiety in your chest and look away quickly. 
your entire left arm is missing
cybernetic right arm; industrial cyberware heavy-duty solid gray steel; (arm)
This arm is a heavy-duty industrial-grade hunk of upware. You bought it refurbished from an aftermarket seller for about a fifth of its price brand new, and from what you can tell, you underpaid by a lot. This is a reasonably old model, and would be comically bulky on most other people, but thanks to your own height and build it fits you just fine. The armor that covers everything but the joints is an extremely durable gray polycarbonate that isn't used for consumer cyberware anymore due to a lack of mass-market appeal, thanks to how prone it is to scratching. The joints themselves are made of stainless steel, which you have to oil manually every once in awhile. You're proud of this arm. It's probably the one high-quality thing you own, your most prized possession.

How do you figure to manage taking off your only arm? With your teeth?
mask; filter filtration active electronic gas toxin; gasmask
You can't see your mask while you're wearing it.
Your mask is made of a black lightweight plastic polymer: durable, high-quality to the touch, and cheap to produce, with aesthetically champfered edges and decorative lines snaking at right angles through its surface. Active filters glow a soft green on the right and left sides, their fans making a thin whirring sound, pulling air into the multilayered filtration system before it's passed to the inside of the mask for you to breathe. The inside edges of the mask, where the plastic would touch your face, are lined with a soft rubber that, when placed against your face, forms an airtight seal. The mask's elastic strap hangs down from the sides. 
You have little to no memory of a time when wearing an active filter outside wasn't necessary, since the air became toxic when you were very young. You, like everyone else, had to pick up the habit of them outdoors real quick after the first person died, their lungs eaten away into a useless mess of tissue in their chest. The mask also serves as a neat excuse to hide your face.

The air's fucking toxic. Taking your mask off outdoors would screw your lungs up, bad.
You reluctantly take off your mask, displaying your face to anyone around who might see.
(first putting on your mask)
steel-toed boots; steel black work; shoes
These are a pair of thick black leather boots with dark steel toes for protection. As attested to by their worn, weathered leather and tended and scraped toes, you've owned these for many years and taken good care of them to make them last this long. You don't own any other pair of shoes.
leather pants; thick heavy-duty heavy duty
A pair of pants that appear to be dull black leather, matching your shoes, but really are some other sort of material that doesn't require an extinct animal to create and breathes well enough to be used for work. These are a recent purchase on your part, an attempt to fit into the City's neo-punk style better.
yellow shirt; faded band print; (top)
A faded yellow shirt that you keep around despite the holes beginning to wear in it for the sake of nostalgia &emdash; it's got a home-made print on it, of your favorite band from back home.
jacket; micro-shell shell gold circuit; coat
This jacket is made of a thick, shiny material that's supposed to be near impenetrable by temperature or bullets &emdash; according to the ad-copy, anyway. You have no intention of actually testing that last part out. Embossed black filigree plays down the shoulders and breasts of the jacket, the pattern seeming to writhe every-so-slightly as you stare at it, matte against the glossy surfaces. It's a recent purchase on your part, like your boots, an attempt to fit into the City's neo-punk style better, and you have no regrets.

A gust of wind blows a sheet of acidic drizzle into your face, smelling of the city\'s sewers and tires.

Far away, one of the skybound monorails rushes past in a whoosh of displaced air and an electric warble.

You glance up and down the street, then make your dash through traffic.
You wait patiently for a gap in the cars streaming by, and when one finally arrives, you rush across the street.
Just before you take a step into the street, a car you didn't previously notice whizzes by, splashing you with toxic sewer water. Once it's gone, you continue your journey across the street
Someone pushes past you, grunting an incomprehensible word which might be an apology or just as easily an insult.
Cars drive past with the low ripping sound of tires on asphalt, throwing up streams of dirty water. The sound of car horns and and electric motors soaks every cubic millimeter of the air with an endless background noise.

The sun filters through the dense black pall of clouds which churn above the city with a febrile gray-green glow which seems to infect the streets and towers around you.
The neon glow of the city's splendour, only fully revealed after night falls, projects a bright kaleidoscope of contrasting colors, from bright yellow to electric blue, across the unbroken cloud cover, reinforcing a sense of clausterphobia even as it dazzles you.
The clouds blot out the sky above you light a midnight black funeral shroud draped suffocatingly from the tops of the city's towers.
sidewalk; cracked dirty gray grey; pavement ground floor
The sidewalk might once have been white, but has long since been dyed gray-black by layers of ash, soot, dirt, and other kinds of grime, forming an unspeakable patina that glistens wetly in the eternal acidic drizzle. The sidewalk is cracked and uneven where huge pipes from nearby buildings plunge down from their sides and into the city's sewer system, heedless of what was there before.

people; ; crowds crowd
Citydwellers walk hurriedly across streets and along sidewalks, shoulders hunched, black leather or micro-shell collars and hoods pulled up against the acid rainwater spray of the passing cars, faces above their masks closed like login screens with lost passwords. So many people, streams of them passing back and forth, a herd of cattle rushed somewhere by invisible corrals, packed together yet profoundly alone. Each person unique in their ethnicity, their gender expression, their religion, their history, their appearance, each further elaborating on some theme through their cyberware, which ranges from the cheap but flashy to the utilitarian and beyond. Each person equally identical somehow, united in their body language and their struggle to survive.
The streets are nearly empty at this time of day, only a few walking here and there, following sidewalks, crossing streets, entering alleyways or buildings. Here and there, ragged dirty figures formerly hidden by the crowds are visible, hunched against walls, laid out on the street, squatting at corners, their few possessions huddled around them. A few have scrounged up VR goggles and are lost to the bleakness of this world. Empty beer cans, needles and syringes, fast food wrappers, and other detritus litter the ground around them, fluttering slightly in the wind and making a barely-audible pattering sound with the rain.
The streets are just as packed now as they were during rush hour, but somehow the energy is different. <i>Live hard now, do everything you want now, have it all now,</i> the streets seem to say, <i>because tomorrow another twelve hours of your life will be sucked from you.</i> There is laughter, partying, groups of friends, jokes, slapping backs, kissing, fondling, drinking, shouting, there are people wearing their best after-hours outfits, leather and lace and mesh and fishnet stockings and corsets and coats and neon tubing and everything, but there is a desparation to it. It makes you anxious.

M-3B Entrance Hall
This is a small square room of slowly eroding concrete walls, which are painted in an old, chipping gray that you find vaguely distasteful. The exit is east, leading out through the filter-field into the drizzling gloom of the city. West, a few stairs lead up into the 
wash of red light from
shadowy gray-green light of
 the megablock's atrium.
stairs; crumbling concrete entrance; steps
These stairs are made of the same decaying gray concrete as the rest of the megablock's bowels.
You slowly trudge up the stairs. 
As you climb, you idly wonder when the stairways in this godforsaken place will finally give way beneath your feet, killing you.
trash; ; refuse
Trash is everywhere, the refuse of the thousands of people who pass through this entryway every day without a second glance. The corporation doesn't give a fuck, and nobody here has the time or energy to spare to clean it up.
Drifts of trash have accumulated in all the corners of the entryway, and flutter a little in the wind from outside.
You don't need any more fucking trash in your life. You've already got corporations and management bots for that.
M-3B Atrium
The bottom floor of the megablock is a wide open space of concrete interrupted here and there by concrete benches, tables, and what might once have been exercise equipment before the rust took it. It's surrounded on all sides by a densely-packed forest of pillars holding up the floors above. Above you, a shaft rises through the building to the greenhouse roof in the ceiling, through which greenish light sifts lazily down, revealing a dizzying number of apartments all facing inward on the central shaft. A few windows are lighted here and there among the endless ranks. To the south, stairs climb up to the first floor of apartments, where you live. To the west, a short flight of stairs goes down to the entry hall.
A wide, largely featureless expanse of concrete serves as the floor of the tower's atrium. It is interrupted here and there by concrete benches, tables, and rusted exercise equipment and surrounded by pillars. To the south, a flight of stairs climbs up to the first floor of apartments (where you live). To the west, a short flight of stairs goes back down into the entry hall. 
Red lights flash ominously from their previously hidden hiding spots tucked up against the tops of the pillars, washing the park benches and exercise equipment in crimson neon highlights

These stairs are made of the same decaying gray concrete as the rest of the interior of the megablock.
atrium attractions; rusted concrete iron metal exercise; bench benches table tables equipment
Judging by these halfhearted attempts at creating a livable space for people to gather and enjoy themselves, some sort of concrete park, the atrium was probably originally intended as a gathering place for residents. No one actually comes here after the first time though; it's far too inhospitable.
pillars; thick support; beams
The pillars are old, pitted, but somehow the only things that don't seem to be crumbling in this place. Thank fuck for whatever corporate sellout had the heart left in them to actually design these well.
window; lighted dark; windows
Rows upon rows, floors upon floors of apartment windows stretch up through the atrium above you. They're too distant to see through, and probably would be even if they were close up, given how dirty everything here is.
M-3B Floor 1
This is a narrow, gloomy walkway. On the south side, row upon row of apartment doors and windows stretch off to the east and west, while on the north it is crowded by a simple concrete and metal banister broken only by a stairway down into the atrium. Much of the already dim gray-green light from the atrium is blocked by the bottom of the walkway above you, casting most of this passage into shadow.
apartment door; pink apartment 104; entry doorway
Your apartment door lies on the floor of your apartment, bent and splintered along both vertical edges, hinges hanging from one end like grotesquely deformed bones.
 This door has been covered in so many layers of graffiti by its successive occupants that an archaeologist might be able to trace the ephemerable trends in low-life culture through its skin. Two graffitos stick out in particular: some wry soul has written 'abandon all hope' across the top in nearly illegible handwriting. The other is yours, an abbreviation of one of your father's sardonic sayings: 'home is where the roof is.'
The empty doorway to your apartment gapes, splintered, to the south, inviting you in like a bad childhood influence. Your apartment door lies askew inside the apartment.
You see your own apartment's door directly south of you, in the center of the row of doors.
You place your thumb on the fingerprint reader on the door handle, but it buzzes aggressively, and the screen above the reader flashes red. It's locked.
*
*DobjAttack
You punch the door. It barely scratches, but a hollow boom reverberates out into the empty atrium like undead thunder. 
You look around warily, but nobody seems to have noticed. Almost everyone is probably sleeping now, aided by pills or dream encoders or even earplugs, exhausted from work.
*
*DobjKick
You kick the center of the door. It jumps back in its frame slightly, enough to make you feel briefly elated, but doesn't budge past that. The kick makes a drumlike booming sound that echoes around the atrium oppressively.

A simple door handle arches down out of the door at roughly hand-height, the top covered by a glossy black glass screen. A thumbprint icon glows gently on the screen, indicating where to put your thumb to authenticate yourself and access your apartment.
*
*DobjKick
You kick with all your might, stamping your boot flat into the door right beside the fingerprint reader, right where the bolt should be. The door lets loose a sepulchral boom which echoes around the atrium like undead thunder. Underneath it, you just barely hear splintering, and the sound of rattling metal. 
You look around warily, but nobody seems to have noticed. Almost everyone is probably sleeping now, aided by pills or dream encoders or even earplugs, exhausted from work. But who knows how long that will last against the thunder of your assault against the door.
You kick again, slamming the flat of your boot into the door's weak spot. Now the splintering is far more audible, as well as the shriek of bending metal. <i>It's working!</i> Somewhere far away, you hear murmurs in the apartments around you. You're starting to draw attention, and that's not good. Property enforcement is bound to come down on you like a military-grade firewall...
Your leg muscles already burning from kicking, panting slightly, you kick again. Now the door is noticibly bent and set back in its frame. <i>Come on,</i> you think. <i>This is the stupidest thing I've ever done, but I can do it.</i>\b
Orange warning holograms begin flickering in around the entrance. <pre>WARNING WARNING WARNING</pre>\b
Your final kick sends painful reverberations up the bones in your leg, but it doesn't matter. With a final unholy <i><b>CRACK</b></i>, the door flies backward, skidding across the floor of your apartment until it comes to rest against the far wall. Almost instantly, red augmented reality holograms pop up all over the atrium behind you and plastered around your apartment door like enraged moths.
<pre>WARNING: LEGAL VIOLATION: BREAKING AND ENTERING</pre>
<pre>WARNING: LEGAL VIOLATION: FELONY TRESSPASS</pre>
<pre>WARNING: LEGAL VIOLATION: AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ALERTED</pre>
Swiping the alerts away from the entrance, you step into your apartment. You've only got a few seconds to grab your shit and run now. 
M-3B Floor 1 (East Corner)
Another featureless corner just like the one at the west end of the walkway, an accidental liminal space.
This corner is a strange lacuna in the densely-packed apartments of M-3B, a place where it doesn't really make sense to fit an apartment, because the others are packed so closely on either side that the door itself would have to be bent in half, yet represents more free wall space than average. It's a strangely liminal space, made even more strange by the fact that, due to the geometry of the walkway above, a little more light from the atrium filters down into it. Instead of the atrium floor, it is these corners that have become the <i>de facto</i> gathering places of the megablock residents &emdash; when anyone has the energy or time to gather, which is rare. The walkway turns north here, onto further rows of apartments.
A slightly brighter corner of the first floor, in between apartment doors, where the walkway turns north.
Far above you, you hear a shout, and a moment later something hurtles past out in the atrium and hits the bottom floor with a splat. It sounds like a piece of food, hopefully.
You hear a woman scream, and then nothing for a long while. Then the sound of voices talking loudly.
Someone brushes past you with out a word.
Two children run past behind you.
The gentle rush of air through the vent momentarily makes a long

trashcan; rubbish; bin, can, trash
A metal wire trashcan, overflowing with mostly plastic wrappers and other needlessly wasteful packaging pieces from all sorts of purchaseable items, including frozen food and technological flotsam like chargers.

After a lot of digging around, forcing yourself to ignore all the strange, slick, running textures and sticky pieces of packing that you encounter, you finally come across something interesting: a small, flat metal wrench. It's taped to a shred of cardboard with what looks like assembly instructions for some kind of cyberware on it. A throw-away tool for assembling the parts of a cheaply made piece of iron then. You fish it out.

The vent provides air conditioning intake for the houses around you, drawing from the air in the atrium, which in turn comes through the forcefield filter at the entryway. Thus, clean air is provided with only one filter necessary. The ultimate in utilitarian efficiency.
 This vent has a metal grate screwed into the concrete in front of it. Although the steel underneath reamins as strong as ever, the grate's surface is almost completely corroded with rust. Even the bolts at each corner of the frame have been worn down to basically flush with the frame itself.

M-3B Floor 1 (East Side)
Another interminable row of doors and windows, all scratched, pitted, and defaced, stretches away northward on the east side of the walkway. None of the windows are lighted or show any signs of life behind them.

The blinds on this window are closed, only letting a few bars of yellow light slip out.

The door farthest to you down the hallway might once have been black underneath all of its layered graffiti, but it's hard to tell. The window next to it has not had its blinds drawn closed, unlike the first one, but only a faint blue light shines out, flickering almost subliminally, like a cathode ray tube's glow.

You knock. A moment later, you hear an unintelligible, but clearly unwelcoming, shout.

The blinds on this window are open, giving you a view of the apartment beyond. The apartment's main lights are off, so it is only lighted by the bright blue glow which emanates from deep within. The light throws everything into deep black silhouettes and sharp outlines, making it difficult to discern the exact nature of anything, but it seems to originate from a prone figure which lies surrounded by a spiderweb of cables and machinery near the rear.

You try to unlock a few of the doors with your fingerprint, but they all reject you, as expected, and you doubt there's anything in them that'd make breaking in worth a damn.

You try to peer into a few of the windows, but you can't see anything through the grit, scratches, and gloom.
protective overalls; (his) plumber janitor; pads jumpsuit; them
A simple, heavy duty jumpsuit, designed to provide full body protection with a strong material resistant to cuts and scratches, and rubber shoulder and knee pads.
You hear a rhythmic rattling noise, probably from some misaligned circulation system, from somewhere deeper in.
Air rushes past you on its way through the maze of shafts with a whoosh that flutters your clothes.
A hollow metallic booming, sighing sound reverberates through the vent\'s hollow metal skin.
From somewhere surprisingly nearby, through the vent walls, you hear voices in conversation.
For a second, you let your focus drift, and begin to feel the walls of the vent close in around you, the clausterophobic horror of your situation starting to take hold. You grit your teeth and focus your eyes ahead.
Air Duct (Inside Vent)
A corridor of aluminum, studded here and there with sharp screws and barely large enough for you to crawl through, runs into the deep blackness brooding inside the megablock's hollow walls ahead. A faint glow from the atrium casts a few hesitant fingers of light past you into the gloom ahead, revealing that the corridor soon ends in a T intersection. One passageway leads north, following the walkway, while the south opening bends almost immediately back east to follow the south walkway.
As you pull yourself further into the vent, a screw snags on your pants and then rips through, slicing into your knee. Fucking hell.
You shuffle forward awkwardly. 
You squeeze painfully past the screws, which catch on your clothes as you pass. 
You squeeze painfully past the screws, which catch on your overalls but do not penetrate them.
Your knees are already cut enough, and the screws get far denser around thanks to bend east. These pants may be thick, but they're not specialized protective gear.
Air Duct (South, Behind South Walkway)
The air duct here is another screw-studded aluminum corridor, which stretches far away into the darkness. Its floor is lined along the north side with apartment air conditioning vents blocked by grates and fans.

Peering down past the fan and grating, you can see the floor of your apartment, messy as ever.

You jump down through the vent and into your apartment, landing in a crouch on the floor with a clump. For a second after landing you totter, your balance thrown by the missing weight of your left arm, then you are able to get a proper footing and stand up.

A grate not too unlike the one you removed to accesss this duct, although in worse shape.

Although your right arm is undoubtedly strong, and dexterous enough for day to day tasks, unscrewing a tiny hexogonal bolt with your bare fingers, when it's mostly embedded in the surrounding metal, is just beyond their capability. 
Hell, it'd probably be beyond the capabilities of your original 'ganic hands too, although a part of you bitterly wishes you still had your left arm.

*DobjUnscrewWith
You can't unscrew the grate with that. 
With surprisingly little effort, you're able to screw the bolts out of the grate. Freed, the gate and bolts fall through the vent and onto the floor of your apartment with a clatter.
Air Duct (North, Behind West Walkway)
The aluminum corridor stretches away to the north for what seems like miles, dwindling to a point somewhere in the deeper blackness at the far end of the building. The whole length, as far as the light will allow you to see, is dotted here and there with impossibly sharp screws driven through the metal frame. To the south, the corridor continues to the south, broken only by the dim light of the exit to the east. At regular intervals corresponding to the apartments below, rectangular indentations push down out of the east side of the corridor's floor, ending in gratings and fans that pull filtered air from the ducts. Light from only the first three of those apartments illuminates the roof of the corridor in shifting orange hues.
You crawl forward through the ducts for awhile, but eventually you lose interest and shuffle back.
You're unwilling to risk further lacerations by crawling deeper into these ducts without some way to protect yourself.
first grate; rectangular apartment first; (grates) vent indentation fan filter
You see an old leather coat hung on a hook taped to the back of the door of the apartment the grate vents into. It's real leather, faded from black to grayish black, and dusty with disuse. The black stitching that holds it together is patterned in decorative lines that sweep in long arcs and then bend in sharp parallel angles, like stylized circuitry. There's something special about this jacket, though: on the inside of the high collar, a flexible screen peeks out, designed to be hooked up to a cortex jack like a netrunner might have. 
<i>What's this person's story?</i> you wonder.

second grate; rectangular apartment second; (grates) vent indentation fan filter
You look through the grate closest to you. It's difficult to see through the slats of the grate and past the blades of the fan, but you appear to be looking down at a generic welcome mat. Two pairs of shoes stand on it, a bair of huge rubber work boots not too unlike your own, and a pair of pink children's sneakers. 
From somewhere further inside the apartment you're looking into, you hear the sound of a man sobbing.
 On the wall next to the door, you can just make out an old janitor's overalls with thick rubber knee and elbow pads.

third grate; rectangular apartment third; (grates) vent indentation fan filter
Peering through this grate and the fan behind it, it's difficult to tell what you're looking at for a second. Then you realize that the floor is completely hidden in trash. Drifts of it. Piles everywhere. Used food cartons, packaging, other trash you can't even identify. It looks like no one's cleaned here in ages. Not only that, but it's not the apartment's light bulb that's casting light here, but the bright blue glow of... something, further inside the apartment.\b
 Just before you're about to look away, you notice something: all three of the power sockets in the wall near the door have cables plugged into them, which snake away deeper into the apartment. Every now and then, you see them move, as if something is moving on the other end of them. Listening closer, you can hear the sound of someone shuffling around inside the apartment, speaking to nobody at all.

*DobjLookThrough
Apartment 104
Your apartment is a small one room studio with unpainted concrete walls and a plastic floor designed to look like tile. In an attempt to make the place more livable, you've covered the walls with posters over the past few years, creating a profusion of bright, clashing colors and shapes which is somehow both mildly nauseating and far more pleasing than the blank walls. Other than that, it is densely populated with the necessities for life, a cozy approximation of habitable living conditions which you've, against all odds, begun to grow fond of. To the south, a door leads to your cramped bathroom. 
The advertisement spot murmurs 
an ad jingle
some corporate slogan
a long list of disclaimers and side effects
 in the background. 
You hear someone murmur in one of the apartments next door. 
You hear the sound of two people arguing a few apartments away. The voices rise louder and louder, until they are practically shouting and you can almost make out the words. Then there is a cry, and the arguing stops. You swear you can almost hear a

 sobbing. 
You hear the muted whirring and gurgling of the pipes outside your southern wall. 
You hear a loud

 from above you. 
You start to step out of the door but quickly turn back. It feels like you're forgetting something important...
You slide the door to the bathroom into the wall to the left and step into your bathroom. 
futon; convertible; couch bed
This futon came with the apartment, left behind by the previous owner. You did your best to clean it before using it, but who knows how clean it actually is. It certainly doesn't <i>look</i> clean, anyway, but you've long since given up caring about looks. A thin, well-worn pillow in a blue pillowcase, and a thick green cotton blanket, both of which you've kept with you since your first apartment at sixteen, sit in their respective places on the 
couch

You see your futon pushed against the east wall, covered in a rumpled pile of blankets from when you got up this morning.

With a heave, you lift the edge of the futon bed and coax it into folding back into a couch.
nightstand; cluttered bed; table drawer
A small nightstand of rough black metal, a few feet square, with a drawer underneath. It serves double duty as a table as well, especially when you've collapsed onto the couch to watch TV until sleep takes you after a long day at work. Food wrappers, empty cans of soda and filtered water from the dispenser, and pieces of paperwork, are scattered across its surface. Two items of note, however, are your Takagi DEC-11 and your e-ink notepad, which lie carefully set apart from the trash.
You see your nightstand next to the futon.
medicine injector gun; estrogen medication drug valerate
A small self-sterilizing reusable intramuscular injection gun, made of white plastic and stainless steel, with a small pointed cone forming the muzzle, where the needle flickers out from, and a small vial fitted into the open bay in the top. The one thing you need more than pretty much everything else, barring maybe food. Just the thought of losing it makes something inside you curl up with horror. This medicine is why, or at least half of why, you're even in the City, and not back in the Rust Belt town you grew up in. The other reason being it's an economically gutted third-world hellhole of crumbling nonfunctional infrastructure, poverty, and tin-pot theocratic dictators.

*DobjExamine
Reflexively, you grap the medicine and put it in your pocket for safekeeping. 
encryption module
A small, oblong piece of soft-touch black plastic about the size of your thumb. On its back is a row of seven tiny metal pins. This is an encryption module, designed to plug into a DEC and provide it with an application-specific integrated circuit for advanced anti-quantum cryptography which would be far too difficult for the generalized computational circuitry in a normal DEC to handle alone. These are fairly common among hardware and security enthusiasts, since traditional cryptography was made obsolete by advances in quantum computing. You're not typically into that kind of stuff, but an old girlfriend managed to talked you into getting one anyway. You never got around to using it much.
The encryption module attaches to {the iobj} with a quiet magnetic click.
darknet module; dark net onion; antenna
This is a small black dome with a stubby antenna sticking out of the rounded end on a joint. On the flat end of the dome, a tight square of four tiny metal pins pokes out. This is a darknet module, used to route your net traffic via a randomized path through a decentralized shadow infrastructure of routers and destination nodes hosted by individual volunteers, rebels, and enthusiasts instead of corporations. That way, your activity on the net is completely untraceable. You bought this module out of curiosity, but never had the occasion to use it for anything series.

This is a chunky oblong rectangle of black magnesium about a third of an inch thick, over a foot long, and about six inches deep. Designed to be tethered to your augreal system for use for a compute/storage boost and connectivity hub, since size and connectivity in body-embedded systems is typically limited. Its surface is largely dedicated to a lavish but compact mechanical keyboard for those who find air-keyboards unpleasant to use, and a plethora of ports and access bays. Along the left side are two module expansion ports, one with four metal contacts arranged in a square, and one with seven metal contacts arranged in a line.

notepad; eink e-ink; notebook kindle
This is a gift from your dad, state of the art when it was new about ten years ago. It has an e-ink display with a response time under 7ms when an update is needed, giving you both usable performance and extremely extended battery life. It's also far healtheir on the eye than the augmented reality system in your eyes, since it doesn't rely on beaming low power lasers into your retina. You don't use it much anymore, though, so it's turned more into a treasured keepsake than useful tool.
posters; ; decorations decoration stickers signs
You scan the posters. Every bright neon color is represented here, and every shape, whether that of people, animals, cars, tech, or Platonic solids, gives form to those colors. The south wall is mostly movie posters on either side of the bathroom door, while the east is mostly posters for long-gone cars and tech that still hold a soft spot in your heart &emdash; probably from seeing their commercials repeatedly as a kid. Meanwhile, the west wall holds a profusion of crinkled flags.
movie posters
A few large movie posters take up most of the wall above waist height, while a profusion of smaller ones surrounds them. As you look, the poster that happens to jump out at you 
is the one from your favorite old classic, <i>DUNE 2</i>, all desert oranges and browns with windswept, cloaked figures striding across the illustration
is from a recent movie you enjoyed immensely, the far-future space opera <i>House of Suns</i>. The poster is all brooding blacks and grays, with disconcertingly gigantic, detailed ships taking up the background and the serious faces of the two protagonists, one male and one female, staring at each other in the forefront
is a strange old find, a poster from a movie that was lost to time long before even your father was born, called <i>Dark City</i>. The poster shows a strange metal face looming over an eerie Gothic city which reminds you strangely of your own.
A poster for the underground cult classic indie movie <i>Chasm City</i>, released about a decade ago, hides in the corner of your wall, half-hidden by the <i>Dark City</i> poster. It depicts the lone silhouette of a man, bisected down the middle so that one half of him is a solder and the other half looks like a monk, staring up at the strange Melding-Plague raviged biotechnological Lovecraftian horror of Chasm City's melted, mutated cityscape.

The south wall is mostly movie posters.
car and tech posters[n]; automobile sports car tech technology retro old; (ads)
This wall is more sparsely populated than the wall of movie posters. A poster 
depicting the DEC-1 (<i>a classic</i>, you think to yourself), more than twice as thick as your own deck and containing several times the number of access bays,
of the old Honda-GM NSX-2060, a sleek wedge of red sportscar composed of elongated hexagons and triangles,
from a famous old vacuum-bot commercial that was so accidentally sexual it spawned a whole subculture
 catches your eye.
This wall is covered with a few posters for classic old tech and cars.
flags; flag; 
Three flags hang down this wall. The first is from some country you've never heard of, a black and orange sigil on a black background. The second is the flag of the City itself, composed of Roberto Fortesque's golden coat of arms merged with stylized and altered versions of the corporations that hold seats on the Board of Administrators for the City. The third is a five-striped flag in pale pastel shades.
A couple of flags hang on the west wall.
window
You've tried to clean this window in the past, but nothing really seems to make it any less dingy. Its dark, sooty tinge seems to have been baked in at the factory. Cheap manufacturing, maybe. Looking out, you get a fucking great view of nothing much at all but the gray concrete walkway outside, the concrete balcony, and the apartments across from you. Even a view of the desolate bottom floor would've been better, but the angles just didn't work out right.
counter; ; cupboard cupboards countertop sink
Most of this thing is counter &emdash; a counter which would have already been almost unusably cramped had it been unbroken; split as it is by the sink, it must have been designed with the explicit goal of making preparing your own meals impossible. What remains that isn't counter is a simple stainless steel and black glass electric stove, pushed up into the northwest corner.
Taking up most of the west wall is a counter-oven combination which experience has proved nearly unusable in its compact functionality.
picture; picture Polaroid wooden; frame portrait
This picture is another gift of your father's, from before he died. It depicts you, a wiry girl of thirteen with a toothy grin, and him, an old, well-built man with a fiery red beard and a youthful look in his eye, standing arm and arm behind your childhood home. It's the result of one of your father's peculer whimsies &emdash; namely, a fascination for old style chemical photography and rare materials like paper and wood. The material was entirely too expensive, and you remember, even as a thirteen-year-old girl, wanting to chastise him for wasting the money, but you hadn't had the heart. He'd been so excited when he came home with the Polaroid and the wood, rushing you out back to take the picture and then rushing into his makeshift darkroom. He then spent <i>days</i> whittling the wood into a sturdy picture frame, all entirely by hand, while he waited for the picture to develop. It had taken what seemed like ages for the photograph to properly develop, but you'd kept it close ever since. Sitting on the porch of your old house, watching him whittle the picture frame in the cool afternoons after his shift at the factory, while you waited with bated breath for the picture to develop, remains one of your fondest memories.
A tiny old-style printed picture in a wooden picture-frame stands in the corner of the counter.

The oven is a tiny affair, an unholy melding of electric cooktop and microwave oven designed to offer as much utility as possible without actually allowing you to cook anything particularly impressive. Not that you would anyway.

apartment door; ; exit doorway
Your apartment door lies on the floor of your apartment, bent and splintered along both vertical edges, hinges hanging from one end like grotesquely deformed bones.
 This door has been covered in so many layers of graffiti by its successive occupants that an archaeologist might be able to trace the ephemerable trends in low-life culture through its skin. Two graffitos stick out in particular: some wry soul has written 'abandon all hope' across the top in nearly illegible handwriting. The other is yours, an abbreviation of one of your father's sardonic sayings: 'home is where the roof is.'
You see your apartment door, lying bent and splintered, on the floor of your apartment, agains the opposite wall from its frame.
Apartment 104 Bathroom
As evinced by the fact that the bathroom door slides into the wall instead of swinging either in or out, there is absolutely no room to spare here. The bathroom is about five feet wide and twelve feet long, with the west wall taken up entirely by a tiny counter, sink, and mirror combo, and the east wall featuring a showerhead high up just under the ceiling and a toilet underneath it. The entire room is designed to be used as a shower, so it is covered floor-to-ceiling in waterproof plastic designed to look like white ceramic tiles. The plastic bows out from the walls a little. 
small toilet; tiny
A simple white porcelin toilet, of a low-water-use design similar to that found in commercial passenger airplanes. 
showerhead
A simple brass showerhead, designed like the head of a garden hose so that the water is turned on and adjusted by rotating its rim, to save the money needed to actually put proper shower controls below it. 
tiny counter; bathroom
A simple white counter with a sink in the center. 
sink; ; faucit
A small circular sink with a faucit arcing over it.
mirror
A simple mirror. 
You try not to spend too long staring into it, as that can quickly lead to a spiral of depression and disassociation as you begin to notice all the masculine features that your medicine hasn't changed yet or can never fix, begin thinking about the damage puberty caused you, that you could have avoided irreversible damage had you been born somewhere where the medical care you needed wasn't illegal. As you begin wondering how others see you, whether they really see the woman you are, or just another monster.
 Briefly glancing into the mirror now, you see your face. Angular, but still recognizably a woman's. The skin is still soft and feminine, the lips still red and full, the cheeks still round. It looks like you. More than it did a year ago. 
Someone manning a stall nearby calls to you, waving you over.
A woman who might almost be <i>like you</i> nods and smiles at you as she passes by.
A dealer, his coat open to display his wares, catches sight of you and briefly tries to catch your attention.
One of the tents nearby fades to a new color.
The music being played from speakers somewhere in the ruins reaches a creschendo.
A fight breaks out between two street merchants, the ensuing battle briefly drawing a small circle of onlookers before it ends abruptly.
As you pass by a tent, someone stumbles out of it backwards, arms windmilling, thumping onto the ground near your feet. Moments later, they are followed out by an enraged proprieter.
Someone offers you synthmeat on a kebab. It smells surprisingly good, if more oily than the Middle East.

people; ; crowds crowd
Now that it's past midnight, and the tent shops and street vendors have packed up and closed down to sleep for the night, this place is mostly empty, except for a few people loitering here and there, wandering between the few places that are open all night long. These are the people that look seedy and listless, sad drunks, battered partners, people looking for an escape of some kind. Here and there, homeless people wander, scrounging from the discarded remains of the day. 
Streams of people fill every twist and turn of the wide dirt path through the market, bustling back and forward along the path or two and fro between the tents and vendors, all talking, bargaining, arguing, laughing. Here and there, people move in small groups &emdash; workers and merchants wheeling in the latest shipment of food or guns or anything else, corporate embassies sent out to secure supplies or services, friends out to explore, gangs &emdash; while others cut through the crowd in a bubble of solitude all their own. Each of the genres of people you can find in other regions of the city are blended together here, brought by the life of the bazaar. 
 
A few people wander here and there.
The behavior of crowd that fills the night market at this hour is much more festive than the weary bustling of the day. People stream in all directions laughing, singing, drinking, hitting up.

gray market; black; tents tent maggots
Tents of all sizes line the ruins to either side of the small track that snakes out from the hole in the fence, from small single-occupant tents with their sides opened to form a sort of stall defended from the drizzle, to huge house-sized affairs. Everything is lighted in a multitude of colors, a warm glow which does brave battle against the perpetual night's terrors. People bustle about inside and around the various tents, laughing, cheering, shouting, haggling, getting into fights, and generally milling about. For all its foreboding setting, this place feels startlingly <i>human</i>.
street vendors; ; stalls stall merchant merchants
Every gap between the major tents is filled with the stalls of street vendors, hawking everything from 3D-printed guns to rugs to posters to synthetic meat to fast food and beyond. No space is left free, either physical or categorical, of shouting, calling, singing, and beckoning merchants and their carts of corrugated metal, cardboard, and plastic, cobbled together from whatever they could find.

Gray hills of rubble, rusty iron rods, and decaying construction equipment, interspersed with the jutting remains of walls, are all that remains of Better Housing Corp's hopes and dreams. This failed follow-up to the first two megablocks was what ultimately led to their bankrupcy, and the auction that landed Megablock M-3B in the hands of a Smile Corp subsidiary.

Ads, ads, and more ads. Everywhere you can see. Augreal advertisements in all their neon-glowing glory spinning and moving and animating in every direction, in every location &emdash; over their respective tents or carts, or over those of competitors, or arcing above you like grand art exhibits for some kind of crazed art festeval. Giant figures tower up into the sky and take dancing steps that make you feel as if you'll be crushed any second by their godlike feet. 
A forest of neon-glowing augreal advertisements hovers over everything. 
Mandible Block (entrance)
An empty stretch of packed gray dirt, always slightly muddy from the perpetual drizzle, is bifurcated by a rusty, leaning chain-link fence here. On the west side of the fence, the packed dirt verges up against the City's central street, which runs north and south, across which is Megablock M-3B. On the east side, through a hole cut in the fence with a plasma torch, the packed dirt opens up on a gigantic lot, easily the size of several normal city blocks, on which lies the shattered bones of Megablock M-3C and, nestled within them like maggots infesting some paleolithic monster's shattered skull, the tents of the gray market.
West is the the central city road, across which stands the megablock, towering imposingly like a blinded lighthouse. East, through a hole in a chain-link fence, is the central track that leads through the gray market.
chain link fence; chain-link chain cut high rusted rusty leaning bent
It's a high chain link fence, perhaps eight feet tall, lined with barbed wire at the top. Rust crusts over it here and there. A hole large enough to step through has been cut into it with a plasma touch, and a beaten track leads through that hole and into the gray market.
You duck through the hole in the fence, carefully avoiding the ragged cut ends of wire.
Gray Market Path
In contrast to the cold elsewhere in the city, the body-heat of hundreds of closely-packed people warms the air, which smells of street food, gun oil, and wet concrete. This is where the path through the gray market begins, at the mouth of the hole in the fence to the west. It widens considerably as it winds away northeastward through the tiny city of tents and street carts and awnings nestled between the ruins. On either side of the path, chains of lights hang from tent to tent, while each tent is lit internally with various hues, some even fading between different colors. To the north, an old shack slouches, with the word 'CLOSED' scrawled across its face in red spraypaint. To the south, meanwhile, a large white tent has been erected. A sign poster has been driven into the ground outside of it saying simply 'FOOD'. A small gap between the tent to the south and the the fence leads southwest.

A small cart made of aluminum tubes and corrugated metal, probably machined right here in the market, with a small box table with a grill inset into it and a simple awning to shelter the table and the vendor standing behind it from the rain. LED light strips wind around the tubing and hang like bunting from the awning. On the grill several varieties of synthmeat sizzle invitingly &emdash; sausages, meatballs, hot dogs, grilled meat patties &emdash; and to the side of the grill, rows of seasenings, toppings, and buns stand at the ready. 
virtual reality stall; ; cart booth stand
A wide stall with a four foot deep table wrapped like a defensive barracade around the man who runs the business from the center, and a canvas tent awning that covers the entire table, including space in the middle of it. The table is made of sheets of cleverly yet inexpertly folded aluminum in strikingly angular shapes. On the table, there is an array of VR headsets on mannequin heads, each with a cheap transparent touchscreen OLED stationed next to it running hardware info and advertisements like placards in a museum.
virtual reality headsets; ; goggles glasses
Most of these models are knockoffs of major name-brands, produced in China. They clearly violate all sorts of patents and intellectual property laws, but nobody really cares to do anything about it. They're so much cheaper and shitter than the originals they target a totally different market. 
A bulky white old-style virtual reality headset with black felt padding catches your eye. You just might be able to afford that one.... then you remember that you don't need it, and buying it would probably wipe you out anyway, and you force it out of your mind. 
A svelte black carbon fiber pair of goggles catches your eye. It's a slim, curved visor that fits neatly over your eyes and blocks everything else out, while still somehow seeming cool and aloof. It takes you a second to place it, then it hits you: it's a knockoff of one of the new Meta-Aiellison models that was released recently. They really nailed the design on this one.
A simple pair of augreality glasses catches your eye, thick black frames concealing primitive pre-2nm backside-power-delivery circuitry and biocompatible cyberware entirely. It's been a long time since anyone has needed those; nowadays, even outside the city, augreality lenses in your eyes are given with the birth certificate.
grocery shop tent
This tent glows bright pale green from the inside, perhaps intended to remind you of fresh green plants and growing things.
 It's been so long since you've had anything like that that it almost makes your mouth water, and you internally chide yourself for falling for such a simplistic marketing manipulation.
 The tent is reasonably large compared to the others, clearly designed to hold multiple tables of wares or merchant stations. It probably represents a conglomerate or assocation of multiple individual sellers, then, and sure enough you can see the decal of a gigantic Southern California sharecropping cartel running along one side of the tent in striking black letters, with more than a dozen smaller circular logos underneath it representing the constituant corporations. The decal seems to have been reapplied multiple times as the canvas under it was ripped and patched over again and again. The rest of the tent is in similar condition, good quality canvas that must now be many years old, patched repeatedly. Most of the tent is held up by thick aluminum poles, but one of its rear corners is actually held up by a decaying section of concrete wall.
closed cyberware shop; red old corrugated metal ramshackle; shack graffiti spraypaint word words
This is a simple shack of corrugated metal, welded together with some not-incosiderable amount of skill and attention to structural integrity, although not the work of a professional or anything close. It isn't small either, more than twenty paces wide at your quick estimation. Despite its sturdy construction, it shows clear signs of age and decay: patches of rust stain its sides, and parts of its roof have been eaten away over the decades by the rain. Graffiti has begun to grow over it as well, just like any other flat surface in this area of this city left too long unattended. 
The door has been taped shut with electrical tape, and one
One
 early piece of graffiti, judging by its fading color and depth in the layers of the stuff, is a huge 'CLOSED' spraypainted across the door diagonally.

A rusty door of corrugated metal, with 'CLOSED' scrawled across it in red letters. 
Old electrical tape holds the door closed.

The rusty door comes open with a long, forlorn creak, scraping a half-circle in the dirt. 
tape
It's smooth black electrical tape, tattered with age and beginning to peel at the edges.

You pull the tape off the door with a stickly peeling sound.
The Closed Cyberware Shop
Pale, sickly greenish strands of light fall gently from the rain-eaten holes in the shack's roof down to the dirt floor, where thick extension cords and power cables snake back and forth like the wiring board of an ENIAC computer, connecting the dim shapes that fill the room. Squarish shapes, shrouded in veils of ragged tarp, loom at the edges, silently watching you.
firepit; fire; pit fire
The fire pit is just a shallow hole dug into the earth and then repacked. It isn't even ringed with anything nonflammable. There is a tiny fire, which barely gives off any light at all, huddled, flickering, in the center of the pit. You can just barely feel its warmpth from here.
A shallow fire pit has been dug into the hard-packed earth in the center of the shack, in which a tiny fire struggles fitfully.
machines; vieled shrouded ragged squareish; shapes squares
You look carefully at the shapes under the tarp, trying to guess what they might be. They are boxy, skeletal, with strange knobs and cylendars and levers making tents in the material. You get the sense it was all some kind of manufacturing equipment once, milling, CNC, bending, PCB printing, picker/placer arms, soldering robots, 3D printers in every material imaginable, all still pretty state of the art. You imagine this place might once have been able to manufacture almost anything electronic under the sun.
tarp
A thick, incredibly heavy cloth cover of some kind, which reminds you of the swimmingpool covers you saw back home when you were very young, before the sky clouded over and the acid rain began. It's black, or maybe navy blue, and frayed at the edges.
You try to pull the tarp off of some of the shapes to see what's underneath, but the tarps are just far too large and heavy for you to move by yourself
, especially with only one arm
. 
cyberware shop door
The inside of this door is little different from its outside, except for a decaying piece of paper that's been stabbed into the door with a knife.
You notice a decaying piece of paper pinned to the rear of the shack's door.
legal notice; thick white; paper
It's a piece of thick white legal paper, the kind corporations still sometimes like to use for notices and legal documents when they want to be below-board enough for it to be deniable on the 'net but official enough to intimidate people. This one has begun to decay quickly in the musty, acidic air of the shack, but some of it is still readable.

worktable; dusty work wide; table desk
This table stands alone in the center of the room, covered in a thick layer of pale dust, like an altar to long-forgotton god. 
The center of the room is empty, except for a long worktable.
wires; extension power rotten; cords cables
These wires cover much of the floor, snaking back and forth in a tangled web. Here and there, the wires are bundled together, as if in an attempt to bring some order to the mess, but it's clear that whoever did this quickly met with defeat in that regard, as the overall system grew over time. The wires are now half-embedded in the packed dirt floor of the shack, sunk in after many cycles of harder rainstorms and then periods of relative dry, and their rubber casings have begun to fall apart in places, as the cheap material begins to give up at last.
The Grocery Merchant Shop
The tent's spacious interior is wrapped in baggy canvas sagging between rows of leaning tent-poles and bathed in pale green light from ancient flood lights hooked up at its corners. Here and there, industrial fans in wire cages fight a desparate war against the heat and humidity. Wires tied by zip-ties snake up vertical poles and hang in bunches from horizontal ones above you. It is all frighteningly low-tech, even for this area of the city, and it also makes you mildly clausterphobic, a feeling which is only made more severe by the tightly-packed rows of plastic folding tables laid out underneath it, holding baskets, boxes, crates, sacks, and piles of every kind of fresh or canned food imaginable. Here and there, flies alight on the wares, then are shood off by tired-looking sellers with waved handkercheifs. For some reason, the thin black sheen of the tent's wiring reminds you of those flies.
A pale green light fills this tent, shining on snaking wires, sagging canvas, industrial fans, and rows of tightly-packed plastic folding tables holding all sorts of fresh and canned foods. Flies buzz everywhere. The exit is back to the north.
people; ; person crowd crowds
The tent is packed with people wandering about and inspecting the wares or haggling with the merchants behind the tables over prices.
merchants
They look hot and tired. Most of them are not even from here, beleaguered small-time farmers or resellers from elsewhere in California, almost universally wearing the pins of the massive sharecropping corporations down south. They are uniformly sun-tanned, thin, and have had various parts of their body replaced by ancient non-biocompatible cyberware that still uses stainless steel and primitive hydraulics and requires regular immunosuppresants to prevent rejection. Expensive drugs which function both as prerequisite, lifesaving drug, and means of control. Not to mention that it's harder for immunosuppressed people to organize. Many of them wear goggles or face sheilds over their masks to prevent infection.
Tired merchants stand behind the tables, haggling with insistant customers and performing transactions.
back desk; rear
A simple white plastic table, dented and scratched. It doesn't look like it's been moved from this spot in a very long time, judging by how far it's sunk into the muddy ground. 
Far at the rear of the tent stands a smaller folding table with a folding chair set up behind it, on which sits a corpulant man.
food; fresh canned white plastic; tables crates boxes sacks baskets barrels piles
The food is mostly things like fruit and vegetables, canned fruit, beans, and other canned items, and baskets of stables like potatoes and yuka. 
Looking through it, you quickly realize that this is not the sort of \"grocery\" store you're used to &emdash; designed to provide quick premade frozen meals and yeast cannisters for food dispensers. This is where people find real, fresh, actual food. You can't imagine how expensive most of this is. You wonder why it has to be sold here in the gray market instead of elsewhere. Is it smuggled in to avoid taxes? Is it food discarded from the larger fresh goods retailers the rich in Northside use, which doesn't meet the health regulations designed to create regulatory capture?
Small Alley (behind grocery)
It's a small dim alley. The lights, sounds, and smells of the gray market feel muffled here. It's almost nice to be away from the hype and bustle of the market. To the north is the back of the grocery tent. A small opening left between the tent itself and the large standing ruined wall that holds up a rear corner invites you in. 
You duck into the grocery tent discreetly. No one seems to notice. 
Gray Market Path (northeast)
This part of the central thoroughfare bends southwest toward the market's entrance and the grocery tent in one direction and due east in the other, running through the tents, stalls, vendors, and ruins to either side. Just north of the path here a gigantic three-storey section of the ruins which hasn't quite collapsed yet has been repurposed to serve as The Dionysus, a brothel: glowing wireframe augreal bodies stretch and twist in erotic pantomime in front of its top story, tantalizing passersby with what they might find inside. The whole front of the building has been closed off with sheets of plastic and canvas to make it a fully-functional building, 
and the strobing, fading light from inside, mostly blues and reds, spills through the opaque walls to paint this whole area of the path in shifting colors
empty off-white and dirty gray lending a dead look to the place with the lights off and no one inside. It seems to wait patiently for nightfall, when it turn its lights on and lure customers in, like a predator plant of this new urban jungle
.
This part of the central thoroughfare that runs through the gray market bends southwest toward the market's entrance and the grocery tent in one direction, and due east in the other, running through the tents, stalls, vendors, and ruins to either side. Just north of the path here is the brothel.
ramen noodle cart
A small corrugated metal noodle cart, complete with a small awning lined with glowing round lamps, a slim section of table with bar stools on one side for customers, and a small portable kitchen to prepare the food on the other side, where the cart's owner stands hard at work. An artistic rendition of a bowl of ramen noodles has been carefully painted onto the front. The rest of the corrugated metal has been painted to look like bamboo.
brothel; chicken wire rubble construction; tunnel vehicle
A massive section of megablock M-3C which hasn't quite collapsed yet, repurposed to form an impromptu building in its own right by the ever-resourceful incohate collective intelligence of the night market. The building has been propped up and repaired in numerous places with metal pipes and I-beams, probably salvaged from elsewhere in the ruins. Around the base, a few rusted-out construction vehicles have been tilted onto their sides and serve as structural shoring for the first floor and foundation. 
You hear moans, screams, shouts, and cries of agony and joy from inside the brothel, as well as the rhythmically thumping beat of some techno song. The opaque plastic and canvas walls alternately take reddish, purplish, and bluish hues from the lights inside, and you can see bodies writhing in ecstasy silhouetted against that light.
The opaque plastic and canvas front walls of the brothel reveal little, dim and dark, waiting for the city's night life to begin.
The brothel\'s advertisements spin and dance, flexing wireframe augreal bodies with erotic grace. 
"The ultimate erotic experience," a femme voice croons from the brothel speakers. "You don\'t have to be lonely anymore..."
"Party below," a femme voice croons from the brothel speakers. "And get intimate above &emdash; like a never-ending house party!"
"Welcome to The Dionysus," a rich masculine voice croons from the brothel speakers. "Where our drinks, music, and ecstatic strip tease dances will free you from self-conscious care and worry. Forget your job for a little while..."
A tunnel constructed out of chickenwire fencing and concrete rubble leads into the brothel to the north.
As you pass into the tunnel, both the sounds of the brothel and the larger market outside are temporarily muted. But as you travel down its length, the sound gets louder, until you finally part the heavy plastic curtains and step into the brothel itself and are accosted by overwhelming sound. 
The low thumping techno beats of the brothel shiver and quake in your ears and stomach. 
Moans and cries of ecstacy or pain echo from the brothel\'s upper stories. 
Blots of blue, red, and purple light play games across your path. 
The brothel changes over to a new song, another thumping, driving, bass-heavy techno beat charged with erotic energy. 
There is a collective cheer from the crowd inside the strip club part of the brothel, as some last article of clothing is shed or some new dance move is pulled off. 
Someone from the crowd wanders almost dazedly up to the brothel building, notices that it's closed, and wanders away again. 
Someone, a worker there perhaps, slips into the closed brothel. 
A dark-suited bouncer strides out of the closed brothel, clearly out on an errand. 
office door
The Brothel
This first floor serves more as a strip club than brothel, the fusion a product of mutual convenience and serendipity, due to this section of the megablock being the only place in the market that could sustain the floor space for both endeavors, but the combination seems to have reached an orgasmic symbiosis. Blue, red, and purple lights splash the stage at the north end of the room with alluring neon hues perfectly calculated to get anyone aroused. 
Men, women, and others dance frantically, ecstatically, on that stage, some around poles, some in pairs or triples, some by themselves, smooth waxed bodies pressing against each other. Beside and around the stage, and walking through the crowd, sex workers ply their trade among the primed audience.
The stage is empty for now except for a few forgotten pieces of outfit and chrome poles drilled into the ceiling, but you feel certain it will be bustling as soon as night falls.
 The rest of the room is bathed in inky darkness, tinted only slightly by the stage's lights
, and is packed with onlookers, by turns watching the stage and leaving to bring go up the northeast stairs or get a drink from the bar across the west wall
, which reveal a stairway in the northeast corner of the building and a bar along the west wall
. 
To the east, a small doorway hung with plastic curtains opens off into a cream-lighted room.
The first floor of the brothel, which serves as a strip club. Blue, red, and purple lights bathe the stage
 and the undulating bodies of the dancers
 to the north, leaving the rest of the room
 and its crowd
 deep in darkness. The exit is across from the stage to the south, while the northeast corner is taken up by a stairway
, and to the east, a small doorway hung with plastic curtains opens off

You're not feeling particularly in the mood right now. 
Especially not with one arm.
crowd; ; audience people crowds
The crowd is rowdy, rambunctious, shouting and cheering at the performers on stage, milling about getting drinks, carousing, and going upstairs. They are reduced to vague, dark shapes by the gloom, somewhat amorphous, a single collective entity.
The room is crowded by the amorphous mass of the strip club's patrons. 
bar
A chromium strip of gleaming metal flows across the west side of the room, with a line of bar stools in front of it and a mixing area for the automated bartender to work at behind it, along with racks of various drink ingredients. 
The strip club's bar runs along the west wall.

Circular black-cushioned stools stand in front of the bar

automated bartender; auto; mixer
The automated bartender is plated in chrome like the bar itself, its body a beautiful assemblage of curved plates, spines, and rods that all shift in relation to each other in eerie imitation of muscles moving under skin as it moves and flexes
 selecting ingredients, mixing drinks, and handing them out to customers with blurring speed and frightning precision, almost too fast for your eye to see
 cleaning the bar counter.
 It has a ten fingered hand which is assembled with the intricacy of Swiss clockwork, a million tiny servos in the palm driving metal ligaments which allow the jointed fingers to move with ease and precision, all covered in plates that shift to allow maximum flexibility.
Behind the bar stands a robotic arm
, mixing and serving drinks
, idle for now, waiting for the nightlife to begin
.
The Mistress\'s Office
This is a small one-room apartment, not unlike
 &emdash; you notice with a pang of regret &emdash;
 the one you used to have in megablock M-3B, but it's been converted into an office. Wood paneling lines the walls and ceiling, and although you know it must be fake, you find it oddly effective at making this place feel like a real corporate office. Some sort of bas-relief sculpture is embedded into the wooden walls, running the entire width and height of them. The room is lit by soft white light strips attached to the ceiling, which shine down on a lavish cream carpet.
desk; intricate; table
The rich brown material of this gigantic desk, which looks like shiny amber and chocolate mixed together and frozen mid-flow, appears to have been 3D-printed using a fine-resolution resin printer of industrial size. It is designed, like the walls, to look like a wooden desk, given artificial grain and coloring and lacquer, and it truly does look the part. The sides are covered in intricate and very explicit triptychs depicting strange demonic creatures cavorting, playing, fighting, and mating in so many combinations that the designer's psychology must have been one to drive even Freud mad. You feel both intranced and repulsed by it.
An imposing desk sits languidly in the center of the room like a jungle cat. 
mistress\'s cyberdec; cast iron filigree; cyberdec dec deck
A slim, angular black cyberDEC, fitted into a baroque cast-iron stand designed to look like a weave of branches and leaves and filled with intricate clockwork gears and springs running a fan along the cooling vents of the deck. A few modules have been fitted to the expansion ports of the deck, making a small row of rectangular electronic objects along the top. 
A black cyberDec sits in the center of the desk. 
small potted plant
A small green forest of fennel, or something like it, sprouts up in an exuberant fan of shoots from a clay pot, and a little ivy runs down the pot's lid to surround it. You can't tell if it's real or not. 
A small green potted plant sits in one corner of the desk. 
blue book; nietzsche; birth of tragedy
This is a slim blue book, perhaps less than two hundred pages, with a title in gold-leaf lettering embossed on the side. The title reads: <font face='TADS-Script'>The Birth of Tragedy, by Friedrich Nietzsche.</font> 
The potted plant rests on top of a slim blue book with golden lettering on the side.
bas relief scuplture; bas-relief bassrelief; walls wall
Bass relief images of satyrs and Pan and Dionysis and fairies and fey and succubi and incubi of every erotic permutation parade around the room in Dionysian festive glory, framed by grape vines and tradgadean masks. The very sight of it makes you want to shed your clothes and join some ancient elder orgy with fey creatures. A strange rollicking song seems to fill your head for a second:\b <i>
 Come, come, come, come, come along now\n Run away from the hum-drum\n We'll go to a place that is safe from\n Greed, anger and boredom\n...
 We'll dance and sing 'til sundown\n And feast with abandon\n We'll sleep when the morning comes\n And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs\n...
 We'll be here when the world slows down\n And the sunbeams fade away\n Keeping time by a pendulum\n As the fabric starts to fray\n
</i>
thronelike chair; throne like; throne
This chair might almost be called a throne. Its depth, width, and large, rounded arm rests are enough to make anyone who sits in it look small by comparison, to swallow them up in its plush burgundy cushions, and the high back is scalloped and fanned out to frame the occupant's head and shoulders in a way that reminds you of Sandro Botticelli's <i>The Birth of Venus</i>. Yet somehow instead of making its occupant seem insigificant in comparison to it, its size seems carefully calculated to enhance their imposing presence like a peacock's fanned feathers. Its edges appear to be real lacquered wood, and you can't imagine how expensive that must have been.
Gray Market Path (east)
The gray market's main thoroughfare ends here in a small circular cul de sac surrounded by larger tents
, and the crowd swirls around it and back the other way in a great meandering whirlpool of bodies
. To the north, a long, low gray tent hunches under an augreal depiction of a glowing blue genie with the words 'THE MIND PALACE' written across his chest. To the east, a large building made of prefab building materials has been erected on a cracked section of foundation. A neon augreal ad spins above it, a wireframe mug overlfowing with beer. To the south stands another tent, with a small vertical augreal sign in front of it spelling out 'CLOTHES.' Another sign hovers above the tent, a wrench animated eternally in the process of tightening a bolt. To the northeast, an alley runs between two tents, bending south and out of sight. You can go back along the gray market's path to the west.
This is the end of the gray market's main thoroughfare, a small circular cul de sac surrounded by tents. To the north, the Mind Palace hunkers, smoke leaking from it. To the east, the NeoGothic Bar stands. To the south, the clothes and cosmetic cyberware shop stands. to the northeast, an alley runs around behind the bar and to the south.
The alleyway takes a long and winding path through the ruins, but you eventually arrive behind the grocery tent. 
The Mind Palace
The tent is long, low, and dark, filled with the choking smoke of several different drugs and a murky navy blue light, as well as the smell incense. Standing here, with the smoke wafting back and forth agitated by the motion of dim figures in the gloom, you feel like you've stepped into an entirely different world. Rows of people sit or lie on mats to either side of you, some wearing virtual reality goggles, some talking to each other, some talking to themselves or batting at the air, although it's difficult to tell if they're interacting with their augreal huds or drug-induced hallucinations.
emaciated drug dealer; emaciated sickly; seller
A sickly, emaciated man, with a strange jaundice to his skin, a perverse placticity. A cigarette hangs out of the corner of his mouth, softly glowing, and he's holding a glass of whiskey. He is wearing a long brown trenchcoat that seems to completely drown him with its size.
*
*DobjTalkTo
The emaciated man seems to ignore you. 
The NeoGothic Bar
A gimmick bar. This bar's appeal, if it can be called that, is adopting the neogothic chic of northside establishments, 'bringing it to the masses' as the owner might say. The best it can do in that respect without the requisite soaring architecture and expensive materials, though, is a limp gesture in a vaguely northward direction. The inside of the place is a sleek, shiny black, with pointed arches dividing the interior into smaller sub-areas and green LED strips snaking in angular circuitry patterns lighting everything. The floor is made of squares of plate glass separated by a black grid of frames holding them in place, and lit from below with a soft white light. 
Overall, the place is neither busy nor completely empty. 
It offers a relatively peaceful respite from the chaos outside, and through that, it seems to have reached a steady equilibrium niche. As long as it remains quieter than outside, a few people will always want to be here, but if too many come in, others start to leave, maintaining the balance.
A gimmick bar peddling a shabby imitation of northside neogothic chic, but offering welcome peace and quiet compared to the rest of the gray market outside. The bar stands along the east wall, following the longest axis of the rectangular room.
bar; green glass; counter
A glass counter underlit by green lights so that it gives an eerie green underlighting to everything around it, recalling to mind old black and white horror movies.
The bar counter itself is at the back, running about half the length of the east wall.
The bar runs along about half of the east wall. 
bar stools; ; barstool barstools stool
Circular black-cushioned stools stand in front of it, on which a few patrons sit hunched.
glass tables; white round
Thick, heavy-duty slabs of glass, milled into a few simple shapes designed to slot together into a simple round table and then rounded at the edges to prevent anyone from cutting themselves. Large white LEDs have been installed into the bases of these tables in order to make them seem to glow with an interior light. The light unfortunately shows off the fact that these tables are <i>covered</i> in scratches. 
There are plate glass tables, round and lighted from the inside with a white glow like solid holograms, placed here and there throughout the room.
chair; black filigree cast iron
These chairs are made of black cast iron, cheap yet incredibly sturdy. They might have been made for this bar, or they might originally have belonged somewhere else, you can't quite tell. The styling is almost right &emdash; the baroque details that make up the moulded exterior seem almost gothic &emdash; but not quite neogothic, indicating they might be repurposed. If so, you can't begin to guess where they came from.
Chairs of cast iron filigree are placed in groups of twos or threes around the tables.
patrons; ; people customers
A cross section of everyone you might find in the gray market itself. Maybe tending toward the more introverted ones.
Here and there, a few patrons sit at the tables or at the bar. 
The Clothes & Cosmetics Shop
This is an extremely large tent, larger than any of the other ones you've seen, but poorly lit; racks and racks of used clothing stretch away into the gloom to the south like the ranks of a vagabond army. The place smells musty as only a used clothing shop can, the combination with the gloom conjuring simultaneously a sense of unease and homey familiarity for you. This place is startlingly high-tech for such a simple operation as well. A glowing neon wireframe consensus-hologram, anchored to a nearby cyberDec, advertises the fact that you can check clothes out yourself &emdash; they're each electrochemically tagged, so the moment you leave with any, your account will be charged. The clothes racks also echo this theme: the central pole that the clothes hang off of has strips of UV emittors across its entire length, constantly baking the clothes free of any lice, ticks, or bacteria, filling the tent with a dim purple glow.
This gigantic tent, the size of a small warehouse, is filled with a dim purple glow from the UV lights that shine from the endless racks of clothing that run off into the dimness to the south. The exit is back north.
counter
A small counter made of plastic and bent stainless steel. There are no interesting flourishes or quirks to its design, except unless its rigid adherence to function over form and not making statement is a quirk itself. A cheap old cyberDec is built into the center of the table, providing a fine-grained anchorpoint for shared-consensus augreal holograms and secure payment processing so that customers can see their receipts and pay for clothes.
A small counter stands at the front of the tent, next to the entrance.
consensus hologram sign; consensus-hologram augreal; advertisement ad notice
A simple purple wireframe augreal display, a consensus-hologram, anchored to a nearby cyberDec. 
The augreal hologram advertises the fact that the clothes here have been electrochemically tagged, so the system will know if you leave with any clothes and automatically charge you. It doesn't seem very secure against theft if someone figures out a way to stop the transaction, but you guess this place has enough clothes that it doesn't matter for whoever runs it.
racks of clothes; clothing; racks
Clothing of every style, age, condition, and description hangs from these stainless steel racks, which stretch off into the dim gray gloom of the tent to the south.
cosmetics shelf
A vast stainless steel skeleton of a shelf, about ten feet tall and stretching off many yards into the gloom of the south of the tent.
A massive shelf holding an endless selection of cosmetic cyberware lines the western wall.
The Clothes & Cosmetics Shop (south)
The back half of the clothes and cosmetics tent is so like the first half that it almost gives you a sense of unreality and deja vu. Gloomy, filled with a dim purple glow, quiet, musty. The only difference is that the counter and entrance seem to have disappeared into the murkey gloom, leaving you isolated between head-high racks of clothes which block your view in nearly every direction.
metal fence; ; door
A mesh of stainless steel wire with square holes of about a centimeter to a side. A sign of real neon tubing spells \"JASON'S HARDWARE\" across the fence, dark now, unpowered, probably for what looks like a very long time. The door in the center of the fence is framed by a simple doorframe of stainless steel welded to a gap in the fence itself.
A fence made of metal wires to the south divides the tent east to west. The fence has a small door in its center.
The door comes open with a shriek and rattle.
Jason\'s Hardware (1)
You are stuck first by the darkness, then by the stuffy clausterphobia, and finally, as your eyes adjust, by the endless strange electronic shapes that loom out from every direction in the dimness. Wires, hoses, broken robot arms and heads, VR goggles and headsets, power armor helmets, circuitboards, broken cyberDecs, and all manner of other things, all covered in a thick layer of dust. The fence to the north is lined with shelves utterly buried in these strange electronic objects, and you stand in a thin corridor made of similar shelves, which stand to the east and west like walls. The only grudging concession made to free space is a small gap to allow for the door to swing open and for people to step in or out. The corridor of shelves leads a little way to the south and then meets another shelf full of unidentifiable but fainly menacing dim shapes and turns sharply west, deeper into the labrynth of electronic detritus.
You pick your way carefully through the maze of shelving, trying not to bump anything, shying away from the strange shapes that loom out at you from the darkness as you pass.
metal fence; ; door
A fence made of metal wires to the north divides the tent east to west. The fence has a small door in its center.
The door comes open with a shriek and rattle.
Jason\'s Hardware (2)
There is a small clearing at the center of the maze of shelves, as you might have expected. A bright spotlight deliniates the clearing like a magic circle drawn to keep out whatever electronic daemons might choose to make their homes here. In the center of the spotlight's light stand a small desk with a doctor's chair next to it and, next to those, what appears to be a reclining chair ripped out of some dentist's office. Wires snake to and from the desk, in which a cyberDec is embedded, and between the desk and the dentist's stool.

A simple stainless steel desk with a cheap built in cyberDec, designed to function as a high-precision location anchor for consensus augreal holograms, so that if someone wants to project holograms another person can see, the augreality microprocessors in their eyes can have a common fixed point to figure out where those holograms should be, since ordinarily personal augreality holograms are relative to where you're looking, and augreality advertisements are anchored via optical recognition and GPS tracking based on a central registry, and only have a ten-meter location accuracy. The desk is covered in piles of electronic components, mostly circuitboards and integrated circuits, as well as various tools.
doctor\'s chair; stool
A circular black cushion sits atop a chrome plated stem which fans out to four wheels. A standard doctor's stool.
dentist\'s reclining chair
Mint-colored, well cushioned, adjustable, and huge. Foot pedals for the doctor to adjust its positioning stick out of one side of its base.
Someone shouts from a high apartment window at someone else in another apartment window across the street.
A scream lances high over the apartment buildings from somewhere deeper in this sector of the city.
Someone bumps into you and hurries away before you can pick a fight.
You see a lone child wandering down the sidewalk.
You hear someone weeping from a doorway near you.
There is a gunshot somewhere, the echos ricocheting between the apartment buildings.
A group of men on the other side of the street glances at you, and you feel a chill run up your spine.
Someone jeers at you from somewhere, you can\'t see where.
Someone shouts a slur at you as they pass on the other side of the street.
A mother and her two children cross to the sidewalk on the other side of the street from you as the approach.
people; ; crowds crowd
There are all different kinds of people here, of every imaginable ethnicity, religion, philosophy, and background, every possible sexuality, gender identity, or gender expression, every stage of ability or disability or sickness. Few have extensive cybernetics, beyond cosmetic augmentations like horns, scales, e-ink tattoos, and other such affectations, and what cyberware there is are old models that still use hydraulics, heavy but simple and easy to repair. What unifies them all is their look of utter exhaustion and hopelessness &emdash; red-rimmed eyes stare out at you from sunken sockets with hooded expressions, brows and cheeks prematurely wrinkled with worry-lines, all faces pale and sickly, some gaunt from drugs, others overweight from the cheap food that is accessible. 
People lounge in small clusters of plastic deck chairs and benches under makeshift awnings in the entranceways or balconies of buildings, smoking, drinking, arguing, or cracking jokes with their neighbors, or blissing out on nanotech drugs. Lazy eyes track you with vague, exhausted indifference or stare off into the haze. It is ostensibly loud here with conversation, but there is a subdued undercurrent.
Empty, white plastic deck chairs and benches stand in apartment entranceways and balconies, empty beer cans, needles and syringes, fast food wrappers, and other detritus litter the ground around them, fluttering slightly in the wind and making a barely-audible pattering sound with the rain.
Some people sit in clusters of plastic deck chairs and benches under makeshift awnings in the entranceways or balconies of buildings, smoking, drinking, arguing, or cracking jokes with their neighbors, or blissing out on nanotech drugs. Others dance in small cleared spaces outside, or on the gutted first floors of the apartments, or rush back and forth across the street, making it impossible to walk five paces without almost running into someone. An air of obstinate, desperate energy suffuses this place, as if each person here is trying, and failing, to party hard enough to forget that work begins the next day.
Central City Street (mid)
The six-lane central street of the City, black tarmac shiny in the rain, runs north, past Megablock M-3B towards the business district of the City, and south, toward Warehouse Slum and the coffin hotel, here. The eyeless, staring skulls of gutted office buildings crowd the street like beggars to the east and west, a long-lost legacy of forgotten prosperity carved into brutalist monuments of drab concrete. Despite the width of the road, the narrowness of sidewalks and the crowding of the street by these buildings creates a clausterphobic sensation, as if at any moment these broken-down buildings will collapse in on you.\bA cramped alleyway slinks off to the east, between an office building and the chain link fence of Mandible Block.
office buildings; gutted long-lost bombed-out empty; ruins offices office beggars
The building to the east is about thirteen stories of dirty, brownish concrete and broken windows. The first floor is covered in graffiti, mostly unintelligable except for one phrase which stands out to you, spraypainted in neon vomit-green across the building's door: 'NO CHOICE WHEN THEY OWN THE CHOICES.'\b The building directly west of you is a crumbling, sagging four story office building, with an old, faded sign above the few shattered glass teeth that remain of its double door entrance: 'MURPHEY & SONS.' What it may once have meant, or what business they may have plied, is now long-lost to time, but it must have been an old building, to have a physical sign like that instead of paying for a hologram placement registration. From before that, then. A few decades, maybe.
Alley
This alley is a small sidewalk branching off from the main one to the west, tightly pressed on one side by the tall brown office building to the south, and the high chain-link fence to the north, so that you practically have to turn sideways to follow it. The floor here is broken up sidewalk pavement, long since decaying back into rubble. The alley smells of urine and despair.
chain link fence; chain-link chain cut high rusted rusty leaning bent
It's a high chain link fence, perhaps eight feet tall, lined with barbed wire at the top. Rust crusts over it here and there. It has been bent down substantially in the center, so that you just might be able to climb it, if you had a something to throw over the barbed wire at the top.
Central City Street (south)
The gutted office buildings on either side of the street to the north begin to give way to equally ancient and decrepit apartment buildings here, which show signs of dissolute habitation. The air is hazy with the smoke from cooking fires high up on the rooves of the apartments, and clothes lines attached to pullies stretch in a criss-cross thicket above you, scratching out the sky. This street continues toward the slums and the warehouse to the south, but a smaller street makes a intersects with this one at right angles, turning off toward the Chicano district.
You walk for what seems like half an hour along cracked pavement sidewalks and down dirty asphalt streets, between run-down offices and apartments, some still occupied, some not. Eventually, you arrive at a bend in the road. 
monorail sign; augreal holographic ar augmented reality
This is part of a series of public goods augreal holographs the city's planning board purchased from ARTek soon after the central spatial database of holograms came online, before digital real estate became to expensive and the planning board stopped caring. You can tell by its signature green color scheme and gothic script, as well as the fact that instead of being wireframe its filled in transparently. 
A small augreal holographic sign floats above the intersection, an arrow pointing east, with a little monorail logo next to it. 
concrete tunnel
This is a sort of passageway or arch that runs through the entire apartment above it and out the other side. It's too dark to see inside, but rivulets of water stream out of its mouth, pooling in a depression in the cracked sidewalk at its entrance. At the far end, you can just barely see the other opening, where it presumably lets out. Trash bags sit around the entrance, as if someone put them down for a second while on their way to take them to a dump, but never got around to picking them up again. A few are overflowing, littering their contents around.
You slip into the tunnel, walking briefly through darkness and the sound of dripping water, before emerging into the relative light on the other side.
To the west, you can see that the entranceway into one of the apartments actually leads directly through the entire apartment building and out to the other side, like some kind of dark concrete tunnel. Spraypainted next to the entrance is the word 'COFFIN' in bright red capitals.
apartments; decrepit; buildings
The apartment buildings are packed tightly on either side of the street, rising tens of stories up into the sky, seeming to weigh on you. They are festooned with rotting clothes on clotheslines, forgotten or abandoned decorations, ad-hoc repairs in cardboard or corrugated metal, and crumbling balconies, some holding dying gardens. The buildings are crumbling slowly, and little attempt has been made to repair them. No one here has the time, or money.
The Bend
The Coffin Hotel
The tunnel opens out onto a strange open square surrounded by apartments. 'WELCOME TO THE COFFIN HOTEL,' proclaims a gigantic holographic sign spinning high above you to the west. Next to it, a cartoonish animation of a zombie emerging from a coffin floats in neon green and red. 
<i>Maybe not the best marketing,</i> you think wryly.
 Below this sign, a ribcage of metal tubes and support beams holding rows and rows of coffin boxes crouches like a gigantic fourty-legged spider against the clogged sky. This must be the Coffin Hotel itself, then. Around and behind the Coffin Hotel, hills of garbage pile up in every direction, pushing up in drifts like disgusting snow against the apartment buildings that surround this impromptu dump.
Drifts and hills of garbage surround the metallic spider of the coffin hotel to the west. To the east, a tunnel through an apartment building leads back out.
{The subj coffin-owner} guides you onto the industrial lift's platform and pulls herself into the driver's seat. A second later, she's lifted you up to your coffin. Its gently curved white lid, slick with the drizzle so that it truly does look like a larval egg of some kind, hisses on hydraulics as it lifts up and out away from you, allowing you to climb inside.
The {the subj coffin owner} behind the booth stares you down with cold, lizardlike regard. <i>Don't go there,</i> they seem to say.
coffin hotel; metal; framework larvae larava maggot maggots spider ribcage ribs
The strange, spindly, clutching structure is composed mostly of metal tubing, probably stolen construction scaffolding from Megablock M-3C up the road, but who knows. It's not like anyone here cares. The spider clutches two rows of twenty stacks of four vaguely-translucent white plastic boxes each, all held about four feet apart on every side, like carefully cradled eggs waiting to hatch. Between the two rows is a double-spine of reinforced steel beams wide enough apart to permit a rusty industrial lift on tanklike treds to move up and down the isles and lift customers up to their desired coffin.
coffins; white translucent plastic; rooms
It's hard to tell much about the coffins, besides that they are nine feet long, five feet deep, and five feet wide, and about half of them are occupied, judging by which ones have lights shining vaguely through their walls.
booth; corrugated metal aluminum; table
The booth is nothing special &emdash; it doesn't even bear a name. Just pitted and rusted corrugated silver aluminum, rivited and haphazardly soldered into the rough shape of a rectangular table with an awning.
Closer to you, at the end of the spider's spine, where the head should be, there is a small booth of corrugated metal.
The Coffin
It's frighteningly cramped. You try to lie to yourself, convince your mind it isn't packed into a tiny box only a few feet bigger than itself, with little room to stretch and none to move, but it's impossible. The reality is staring you right in the face, undeniably, in the form of the coffin's translucent white lid and oppressive pale yellow interior lights, shining from LED strips around the lid. The interior of the coffin is padded on most sides in worn-down self-cleaning plastic-covered pillows, even up the walls, where two swells in the padding hide the casings for the lid's hydraulics. There is another, softer swell in the padding where your head should be, and, to your left, a small inset in the wall holds a yeast food synthesizer. A paper sign is taped above it.
Yup. It's the coffin. Translucent white walls and plastic pillows surround you, except for the black rounded rectangle of the food dispenser to your left.
yeast food dispenser; ; synthesizer
It's a rounded black rectangle about two feet wide and two feet tall, jutting out a few inches from the wall. A touch screen is embedded in the upper half, displaying the small selection of imitation of imitation foods it can dispense, and the lower half of the rectangle has a square slot with a hinged door over it, where you can pull the food out after it's done being grown.

*DobjTouch
You key in a meal, and, a few minutes later, you hear a small <i>ding</i>. Pulling open the dispensing bin, you see a food-approximating object vaguely the right shape, texture, and color &emdash; if not taste. You eat it, somewhat regretfully.

coffin hotel owner; gray gaunt sickly metal metallic military; person implants scars studs woman; her
The coffin hotel owner is thin. Not just thin, but gaunt: cheeks sunken visibly even around the filtration mask, hands bony talons, glistening dark eyes hooded, skin stretched over sharp, delicate, birdlike bones. Skin, you notice, that has a distinctly unsettling grayness to it, as if she were not quite... alive. Her dimunitive stature is exaggerated to the point of almost childlike smallness by her hunched shoulders and deeply curved spine. There is something striking about her face, too: it's thin and frail, with a deep dreamy melancholy etched into it, as if she can remember times when things were better, and prefers to spend her days in those memories, instead of in the dirty present. Two small oblong metal studs stick out of her forehead, the skin around them thickened with the scar tissue that's the telltale sign of early cybernetics. You can't remember having seen anything like these implants before in person, but you know from histories that they &emdash; or similar ones, anyway &emdash; were used by the military, for piloting drones and tanks.<.known tStuds>

{The subj coffin-owner} inspects {the dobj} with care, her delicate fingers flipping it around.\b 
She seems impressed by the real wood construction of the frame. \"This is probably worth a lot of money,\" she says, looking at you. \"I could let you stay a very long time for this.\" \b
After looking at the notepad for awhile, {the subj coffin-owner} seems to come to a decision. \"Alright, I can accept this, but just for a night. It's pretty old.\" \b
\"I'm sorry, but I just don't know if I can sell this for enough to make it worth it.\" She shakes her head sadly.
Nodding to herself, {the subj coffin-owner} stands up and guides you around her booth, to the aisle between the rows of larval coffin-rooms. Once there, she gestures for you to get on the industrial lift's platform as she laborously pulls herself into the driver's seat, coughing. You oblige, and a second later she's lifted you to your new home.

Seraphine
\b\"Nice to meet you,\" you say, almost tempted to return the smile. Such a frail person, still willing to smile... 
\"What are those studs?\" 
You ask the question with a little trepidation, but, luckily, {the subj coffin-owner} doesn't take offense.\b\"Used to hardwire into combat APCs,\" she says casually, as if it was the most normal thing in the world. \"That's what these were for, back in the day. Hardlining directly in with optical fiber. I was good, too,\" she says wistfully. 
\"What was that like?\"
\"Exhillerating.\" Then she pauses, and her mouth twists bitterly. \"And horrible, like you can't imagine if you weren't there. And the drugs were good too,\" she says wryly. \"They had to keep us hopped up on the most insane fuckshit imaginable, to keep up with the AIs, you know.\" 
\"Why did they use humans?\" 
\"Because humans are more flexible. AIs are fast, sure, but they're rote. A baseline human still has no chance against an AI, but a human with hyped-up reaction times? Then you have both advantages. And that...\" Her eyes look past you, into the past. \"yeah.\" She pauses. \"Now, what can I do for you?\" 
\"Yeah, I need a room.\" 
\"It's about 30 scratch a night, but I'm willing to bargain. Got the cash?\"

You can't see much of {the subj john} through the crack in the door. What you can see, however, is his face. It is a perfect study in the toll the City takes on a man. His dark skin is deeply pockmarked from decades of exposure to the acid rain, his sunken, red-rimmed eyes squint at you with something between apathy and sorrow, and his mouth below the graying mustache is pressed into an eternal line, chin jutting out. He isn't balding, by some miracle, and dark, unwashed hair straggles limply over his face.

{The subj john} grimaces. \"It doesn't really matter.\" 
\"What's your name?\" 
The middle-aged man looks at you wearily. \"Name's John.\" Resignation weighs his voice down so that his name lands with the limp thud of a dead body. Like he doesn't want to get to know anyone, because he's seen where that leads.
John
 
\"I need your overalls real quick. I'll get them back to you, don't worry.\"
{The subj john} grimaces, looking at you through slightly squinted eyes. \"What for?\"
\"Just got a new job. Work safety is different than the warehouse job I worked before, need some reinforced overalls and shit to keep me safe, but I don't have the scratch right now. Gonna need to work a few weeks before I have the money to buy the gear I need. Figured I could borrow yours and pay you back later.\" 
John nods to himself, considering for a moment. \"Alright. Not like I'll need them anymore anyway, and I could use the money myself.\"\b
He dissappears into his apartment, then reappears a moment later with the overalls rolled up in one hand. He hands them to you with a strange reluctance. 
\"Just lost my job, framed for theft. The corporation was affiliated with the one that runs this dump, so... bad credit, no apartment. Gotta break in and get my stuff before I get the fuck out of here.\"
John gives a sharp, quiet bark of laughter. \"You gotta be fucking joking.\"\b
After a moment, he realizes you're deadly serious, and his bitter smile fades. \"Kid, that's insane.\" Then, adds: \"I don't want any part of this,\" and with that, the door closes in your face. 
\"It looks like whatever it is matters like fuck to you, John. Are you sure you're okay?\" 
John looks at you with tired, confused eyes. \"Look, just leave me alone, alright? What business of it is yours, anyway. You've been here for awhile and we haven't spoken once that whole time, except now. That means you want something. So spit it out, kid, before I close this door.\" 
tall cop; imposing muscular property crime enforcement; police officer; him them
This property crimes officer is a tall, imposingly muscular specimen of porcine flesh entirely covered in standard-issue black ceramic and kevlar SWAT armor, their face hidden behind the visor of a glossy black helmet you can't see through. Four red LEDs trace up the kevlar collar of their suit, blinking rapidly. An oversize high-caliber pistol is slung low on their right hip like some kind of old-world cowboy, and a shield and a shotgun are strung across their back.
You try to swipe {the dobj}, but the muscular officer spots you and, with languid grace, their left hand whips out and locks around your forearm. You twist and turn, trying to pull away, but that vicelike grip holds you tighter than a banker holds his cold storage wallet, until it feels like your arm is going to break. No matter how much you struggle, how hard you try to escape, that grip only seems to grow steadily tighter, and cold panic rushes into you like ice.\b
\"An attempt on an officer's life has been made,\" the cop says, presumably into their comms system. \"Dealing with threat.\"\b
Then, calmly, the officer drwas their handgun and executes you... 
*
*DobjAttack
In desperation and rage, you lash out at the officer, trying to punch them right in that smug fucking black chrome dome they call a face with all your might, servos whirring with the effort of moving that fast. The officer barely seems to move as they dodge your attack effortlessly, then their left hand blurs up and clamps around your wrist with a snap, and you barely have a millisecond to notice their right fist coming around before it makes shattering contact with your jaw, ripping it straight off. White light and nausea reverberates through your head, both at the impact and the pain. You try to scream, but it comes out as a wet gurgle through the bloody ruin of your lower face as you collapse onto the ground. With some sick sense of mercy, the officer then slowly draws their pistol and puts a bullet between your eyes.

Glancing furtively at the taller officer's head, trying to guage where they're looking through that black, mirrored faceplate, you bring your leg around as fast and hard as you can as you pass by toward the door, trying to sweep their legs out from under them. Instead, your leg meets with kevlar and ceramic-armored steel, as immobile as a support beam, and you hear your shin crack with the impact. Screaming in pain, you fall in a heap on the floor, curled in the foetal position around your broken leg. A moment later, you feel the officer's implacible iron grip fix around your collar and begin dragging you to the door, and the patrol car beyond.
The property enforcement officers catch sight of you as soon as you're within visible range, walking up to you silently, then flanking you.\b
\"Citizen,\" the taller one intones through a staticky helmet voice amplifier, \"you have committed a violent offense against private property. As such, you will be imprisoned and work off your debt to the holding company of this property. Please do not resist.\"\b
You back away slightly, afraid, but each officer grabs one of your shoulders and begins hauling you toward the police cruiser. In the few minutes before you are inevitably shoved into the back of that car, a terrible rage and despar grips you. Only one thought circles round and round in your pounding head: <i>Damn it! God motherfucking damn it! If only I'd been a little smarter. A little faster.</i> \b
A tall, muscular property enforcement officer in perfectly black kevlar and ceramic plate, with a gigantic pistol slung low on their left hip, stands to the right of the megablock's entrance.
The property enforcement officer stands impassively, staring at you. 
You begin turning to run, but the tall cop with the gun is faster. With cold cybernetic precision and liquid speed, they draw their handgun and fire. As if in slow motion, the weapon lets loose a gout of flame and a deafening crack that leaves you completely deaf, ears ringing, and you see your side explode in a mist of blood and an expanding cloud of shredded organs and bone fragments. You hit the ground, and as darkness begins to close around you, and you feel a terrible, final falling sensation into blackness, you hear the cop speak over the radio. \"Suspect executed for resisting arrest...\"
oversized pistol; huge cowboy gigantic over-size oversize; handgun glock gun
The handgun is a massive, gray brushed aluminum affair that, despite its size, manages to convey a sense of acceleration and grace through its body design, all straight lines leaning forward. You can't even begin to guess at what its caliber is, but it must be practically a rifle cartrige to justify that size.
shotgun
It's hard to see any part of the shotgun besides its textured polycarbonate and steel handle sticking over the taller officer's shoulder.

While the shorter officer completes a ream of holographic paperwork which floats around them in a blue half-circle like a control panel, the taller one shoves you face first against the police cruiser's flank. Your cheek presses into the cold mettalic surface, slightly damp with acidic drizzle that burns as you touch it, and, with tears of helpless rage beginning to well in your eyes, you surrender quietly as they remove your right arm, leaving you completely helpless. <i>More effective than handcuffs, I guess,</i> you think bitterly.\b 
Finally, the car door swings open, and you are shoved inside. You will not be seen in the City for a decade, and by the time you return, you are a broken woman.\b

"Hey woman, I ain\'t got all day," they say, shaking their head and looking impatient.
"If you\'re not gonna pay up, then why don\'t you just fuck the hell right off, kay?" the vendor says. Then they turn away.
The synthmeat vendor is watching you expectantly, waiting for you to either pay up for your meal or go away.
They are looking at you expectantly, waiting for you to pay up or get out.
\"I know this is left-field, but do you have a ping to anyone that could use a hand, manual labor?\"
The vendor looks you up and down, a smirk sneaking onto their mobile face. \"You certainly spoke the truth sister, it certainly would be just <i>one</i> hand huh?\" Then, before your startlement can turn into anger, they continue. \"But to answer your question, nah, not really. You could talk to some of the merchants though,\" she says, crooking her thumb in the direction of one of the bigger tents. \"They always need more hands bringing new wares in.\"
\"I'd like to buy...\"
Ask the street vendor for:
a sausage sub 
The vendor nods. \"Just transfer me the money.\" 
a hot dog 
The vendor nods. \"Just transfer me the money.\" 
a burger 
The vendor nods. \"Just transfer me the money.\" 
a meatball 
The vendor nods. \"Just transfer me the money.\" 
homeless woman; ; bum tramp; her
Her hollow, sunken, sad eyes, buried in a face smeared with dirt and grease, stare back at you with hopless incuriousness. You wonder if these eyes will be yours someday. Life is harsh in the City. It doesn't care for anyone. It's a moment before you can pull your eyes away from that morbid prophecy and human tragedy wrapped up in one and look at the rest of her. She is thin, bird-boned, and utterly frail, her skin practically transparent, blue veins and knobbly bones showing through. She is bundled up tightly in an assortment of old ill-fitting rags. Doesn't seem to have any cyberware at all.
There is a gaunt old homeless woman crouching next to the firepit, her hands held out to the fire.
sharecropping combine overseer; corpulant; man; him
The man wears a creased, dirty gray jumpsuit with the zipper that runs down the front opened to about his midriff. The jumpsuit seems to be straining desperately to contain his bulk, both his prodigious gut and his thick, trunklike muscular arms. His face is round, florid, mustached, and the picture of jovial good humor &emdash; something he can afford, it seems: he wears the pins of every major sharecropping combine like military medals across his chest.

You walk up to the man behind the desk. Seeing you approach, he smiles expansively, his eyes travelling up and down your body with hungry greed, feeling you up with his gaze. When he finally speaks a split second later, his eyes still largely fixed on your breasts, it feels like you've already spent unpleasant hours with this man. \"What can I do for you... ma'am?\"
\"I'd like to buy something please.\"
He smirks, and, in a clotted, self-satisfied voice says, \"Feel free to speak with our hard-working sharecroppers and merchants then.\" He gestures to the rest of the tent behind you, then rests his hands back on his stomach.
\"Do you know anywhere where a manual laborour might find work?\"
The overseer scoffs. \"Pah. With one arm? <i>Please.</i> Run along and find yourself another arm, darling, and then come back to me and we can talk. Unless, of course, you want another sort of job... I find your kind quite enticing, if you know what I mean. I consider myself a great ally!\"
bouncer; ; man; him
A bitblit copy of every single bouncer you've ever seen. Tall, muscular, barrel chested, bald, in a dark suit with sunglasses covering his eyes. E-ink gang tattoos of some kind writhe on his bald head, shifting between gloriously intricate shapes from some folk fairytale nightmare. It's all so stereotypical he'd almost be funny to look at if he wasn't so intimidating.
You see a bouncer standing off in a corner near the entrance.

Approaching the bouncer, you start to open your mouth, but he cuts you off. \"Am not here to talk,\" he says in a thick Russian accent. \"Talk to the boss. In there.\" He points east. <.known tOfficeDoor> \b
Mistress; ; woman; her
The mistress herself. Tall, taller than you even, and old, perhaps seventy, but in a way that makes her seem like an infinitely wise and alluring demoness. Her makeup is bold, stylized in shades of shiny navy blue around eyes, and arterial red around pouting lips, not tasteless. She wears what seems to be a Victorian corsetted dress of some kind made of diaphanous black silk, lace, and embroidry, run through with spines and ridges which remind you of bats.

You're usually a brash person, but something makes you hesitate to interrupt her. However, you steel yourself and clear your throat, catching the Mistress' attention.\b
The Mistress sighs, looking at something in her private augreal workspace.
The Mistress chuckles softly and makes a gesture, dismissing some invisible augreal window.
The Mistress tsk-tsks, shaking her head.
The Mistress reaches out and does some complex manipulation with her hands, subvocalizing all the while, composing some sort of message.
The Mistress nods to herself.
The Mistress absentmindedly taps her lips, thinking.
The Mistress absentmindedly fondles the plush armrests of her chair.
{The mistress} ignores you, completely occupied by her tasks. 
{The mistress} sits at her desk, working. 
"Well girl?" the Mistress smiles, looking at you. "Cat got your tongue?"
"You know, I don\'t bite &emdash; well, usually." The Mistress smiles mischeviously.
"If you have nothing more to say, child," the Mistress says primly, turning back to her work, "please exit my office."
{The mistress} watches you looking at her with a tiny smile, as if she is seizing you up for eating. 
{The mistress} sits at her desk, waiting for you to say something. 
Seeing you enter her office, the Mistress smiles and waves her hand languidly, dismissing her augreality display. \"What can I do for you child?\" she purrs.\b
\"Are you the owner of this place?\"
\"Why yes I am. The upstairs used to be owned by someone else, but I bought them out,\" she says, inspecting her glossy burgundy fingernails.
\"How did you create all this?\"
\"By fighting like hell for a very long time, kitten,\" she says, looking at you. \"I started out walking the streets, you know. I'm proud to say that, because it shows just how <i>far</i> I've come. Don't you think?\"
Say nothing.
\"Yeah, it's a really impressive place.\"
\"Why thank you! I didn't really expect you to answer, to be honest,\" {the mistress} says, smiling genuinely.
\"How did you convince them to sell to you? Did you really just pay them that much?\"
\"Well,\" the Mistress says, her catlike eyes gleaming, \"I shan't devulge all my secrets.\"
\"Who are you?\"
\"My my, now that's quite a complicated question. 'To indulge the fable of 'unity,' 'soul,' 'person,' &emdash; this we have forbidden: with such hypotheses one only covers up the problem,' to quote a very great man. But I can tell you my name nevertheless: Lea Belveau, Mistress of this place.\" She gestures around her.
Mistress Lea Belveau
\"What are those carvings on the walls?\"
\"Oh, just a little fancy of mine.\" She hums a little tune, as if it's supposed to mean something to you. \"Feel free to look at them all you like. Although, be warned, they have a... <i>corrupting</i> influence.\" This last sentence is spoken with erotic suggestiveness, her voice smoky and dark.
\"Do you know anyone that has any use for a manual laborer like me? I can supervise loader-lifter AIs. Boston Dynamics ones, you know.\"
The Mistress looks thoughtful for a moment. \"I don't really do those kind of jobs child, although I can of course offer you other options. And I'm really not sure how good you'd be at manual labor with only one arm, although I'm sure you already know that. Let me think... Aha! You should speak to Jason, he runs a hardware shop of sorts. He might know.\"
ramen vendor; noodle; merchant; him
A short black man of medium build in a white apron. He moves with incredible precision and speed, arms flickering back and forth assembling bowls of ramen like he's on some kind of assembly line. Yet he does it with perfect ease, a calm look on his face, and he manages to carefully smell each bowl to make sure it's seasoned right and add a small personal touch of garnish. He's just that fast. Surrounded by his small neat kitchen, he seems perfectly at home, and you get the impression he's been doing this for years. Nevertheless, it isn't <i>all</i> natural skill and practice: you can see the telltale signs of nerve and fast-twitch muscle enhancements in specific the black strips of circuitry and biochemcial materials that run up his arms and shoulders, and his eyes have been replaced with good middle of the road Kiroshi optics to allow him to better process information.

The ramen vendor looks at you politely with his glowing blue Kiroshi eyes, hands still working on other orders. 
"Classic ramen noodles, come get \'em," the ramen noodle vender shouts, beckoning people over. 
"Fresh, hand-made, cheap as dirt, will fill your stomach better than any yeast! Ramen noodles!" the ramen noodle vender laughs. 
"Fuck synthmeat am I right? This guy knows what he wants!" the ramen noodle vendor crows as a customer walks up to the bar.
The ramen noodle vendor pulls a piece of paper from the awning and hands it along with a bowl to a customer. 
The ramen noodle vendor is hard at work cooking right now. 
You see a ramen noodle vendor standing behind a lovingly constructed cart, cooking. 
The ramen noodle vendor looks at you impatiently as he cooks. 
The ramen noodle vendor stands looking at you expectantly. 
\"Hey, do you know where I could find Jason's hardware store?\"
He nods quickly. \"Its through the tent to the south, the clothes seller. Anything else?\"
\"I'd like to buy a bowl of ramen please.\"
\"Sure thing, go ahead and transfer me the money with your augreal wallet and I'll whip it right up.\"
\"How long have you been doing this job?\"
\"Since I was a kid!\" he answers, smiling widely. \"And my papa before me too. We've built up our recipes, techniques and sourcing over generations.\"\b It has the feel of a marketing line now, but you get the sense it only became one over time, that it's also true.
Jason
A short, muscular man with a broad chest and thick, gnarled arms. Yet, paradoxically also hunched and pale, as if he works out exclusively in this tiny room. Which he probably does. He is wearing a navy blue micro-shell jacket over olive green fatigues from some unidentifiable army. His face is round, sparsely bearded, and his eyes are a striking dark shade of olive green flecked with gold. He seems good natured and kind, but his sheer compact physicality and intensity makes you want to step back.

*DobjTalkTo
\"Hey,\" you say, walking up behind Jason. He jumps, startled by your intrusion into his little world, and spins around on his stool to look at you.\b\"What's up?\" he asks, after he's recovered from his fright. \b
There is a zapping sound and Jason makes a startled noise of pain and pulls his finger away from something. 
A thin stream of smoke and a mettalic smell wafts up as Jason briefly solders two components together. 
With an frustrated grunt, Jason hops up, dashes into the maze of shelves with infinite purpose, and returns a moment later with some new component for his project. 
Putting down whatever he has been working on, Jason leans back for a moment and rubs his eyes. Then he sighs and returns to work. 
Jason snaps two pieces together, and with an excited cry, something seems to briefly spring to life, glowing and whirring under his hands. Then it sputters out and he returns to work with a curse. 
Jason notices you looking at him and gives an awkward smile. 
Jason is perched on the edge of his stool, bent practically double over his desk, working on assembling something. 
Jason waits briefly for you to continue talking, then returns to his project. 
Jason looks back at you mildly. 
Jason sits on his stool facing towards you, waiting quietly. 
\"'At least as far as everyone else thinks' &emdash what's your real life's work Jason?\"
Jason grins at you, and you can feel palpable excitement roll off him in waves. \"I'm so glad you asked! It's so rare I get a chance to talk about it with people.\" He pauses for a second for dramatic effect. \"Well, to be honest, I rarely get a chance to talk about anything with people, basically no one comes back here and when they do they're all business. It's actually starting to become a problem, I'm really running out of money to buy food and stuff...\" 
\"Well, what is it?\"
\"Oh right, sorry, yeah.\"
\"Are you Jason?\"
Jason smiles. \"Yup, that's me!\"
\"What <i>is</i> this place?\"
You say it while looking around, gesturing in helpless amazement at the endless shelves of technology stretching away into the dimness in every direction.\b\"It's my hardware shop of course!\" Jason says proudly. \"I can repair anything, build any kind of custom hardware you want, trade you any part you need. It's my life's work &emdash; at least as far as everyone else thinks. I also do the cosmetic cyberware implantations. Just buy something out there, then bring it in here and I'll put it in ya.\"
\"How did you even get all this stuff?\"
\"Here and there, mostly. I contract with a lot of corps around here to take all their electronic waste when they're done with it. Not the tiny scraps, but the stuff that can still be used for something. I also barter a lot, if you need a piece to fix some cyberware, for instance, I ask you to find me a cyberware component in return, just a different one. Usually people have that stuff, you know? Planned obsolescence, right?\"
\"Do you know where a manual laborer like me could find work?\"
Jason looks thoughtful for a moment. \"Well, the fact that you've only got one arm tells me you failed an indenture contract. You won't be able to get a legitimate job willing to front you the money for another arm for a couple years. But, I could try to find you someone a little more who doesn't have a big pool of desparate captive workers to pull from, who needs someone locked out of the system, so they're willing to trade under the table. That you?\" 
\"Yeah, I suppose so.\"
\"Alright then,\" Jason says, and his eyes go unfocused for a second as he searches his augreality hud. \"Okay, I think I found ya something. Prick by the name of Nanowire, he's looking for an industrial worker looking to go black, off the edge. I'll send you his contact.\"\b<.known tTheJob>

The clothing shop owner is a short, round-faced middle-aged nonbinary person, wearing a fluffy yellow coat with blue lightning painted onto the back and a simple black tank top and jeans underneath. They look tired, and something about their expression seems far older than their visible age, as if they've seen too many things in their lifetime, all of them terribly sad. You get the sense that this quiet, simple business of helping people find outfits that suit them is a refuge from something in their past, and it makes your heart ache for them a little, involuntarily. A small silver pendant hangs down between their breasts.

About Circuitboard Streets
About the Game
Circuitboard Streets is my first work of interactive fiction. It is a cyberpunk story, directly inspired by movies like Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell, books like Hardwired and Neuromancer, and R. Talsorian Games\' Cyberpunk universe, as well as my own anarchist, punk, queer, and technological ethos and experience (athough it is not even remotely autobiographical).\bIts existence represents a confluence of a few disparate but interrelated factors.\bFirst, the fact that my two favorite hobbies are programming and writing science fiction. Second, that I am deeply interested in semantic (as opposed to numerical/quantitative) logic and simulations in computers, and this has led me to an abiding interest in parser-based interactive fction. Third, that, due to a functional neurologic disorder which makes reading and especially watching TV painful and difficult, I have been playing a lot of parser IF with my girlfriend (she reads aloud to me) as a leasure activity, and I noticed a rather conspicuous gap in the IF genre: cyberpunk and queer long-form games. Fourth, that my FND allows me to work on things for a limited amount of time each day.\bIt also represents two different experiments in parser interactive fiction gameplay and storytelling: first, how much of the feel of immersive sim gameplay, like the gameplay found in Deus Ex, can I imitate in parser IF? It seems very amenible to that sort of problem-solving, world-model-interaction motivated gameplay on the surface, perhaps even better adapted to it than 3D games! And second, how can I subtly and naturally coax my readers into inhabiting the subjectivity of a player character who is likely very different than them, instead of merely experiencing a factually-described world via their own subjectivity, as in most large parser IF works?\b Is all of this entirely too ambitious for someone\'s first foray into parser interactive fiction? Should I have started with a small competition entry instead, perhaps a showcase of just a few of these ideas? Probably. But I\'ve never been able to contain my ambition like that. I\'m an all or nothing person, I either want to lasso the moon or I\'m not interested. And I have no qualms about facing off against an impossible task either &emdash; for me, the fight, no matter how doomed it may be, is half the point. Some things are just worth trying. This is, coincidentally, one of the fundamental themes of the game. So I ask your patience and understanding with this overambitious work, and hope you enjoy it. <3
Augmented Reality and Holograms: Background
In this cyberpunk world, everyone has implants in their eyes that project digital displays into their retinas, allowing them to use augmented reality at all times without the need to wear glasses. This allows a number of functionalities.\b Firstly, there is the ARTek corporation\'s central location-based registry of hologram emplacements. This is a central spatial database of agumented reality displays (holograms) provided by their servers that all augmented-reality-capable eyes connect to to determine if, at their present location and direction, an augmented reality hologram should be visible to the wearer, and if so, how it should be projected into the world for them. This database has a resolution of about ten feet. Companies and individuals can purchase a plot of virtual "land" in this database from ARTek to have an augmented reality hologram placed into the world visible to everyone. This system of course implies that everyone\'s location and heading is constantly streamed to the central ARTek databases, and that is true. In fact, LIDAR scans of the three-dimensional shapes of everything you see are also streamed to ARTek so they can build a live composite three-dimensional scale model of the city so they can determine where emplacements can go.\b The second function of these augmented reality implants is to provide each person with a personal augmented reality hud (heads-up-display) visible only to them, which functions as their combined smartphone and personal computer. This is used for all the normal personal communication and computing tasks, and has basically supplanted all other types of computing, although these eye implants typically have very limited processing power and so more strenuous computing tasks are supplemented with cyberDecs, which connect wirelessly to your augreality eye implants and convert your implants into a remote terminal through which you access the cyberDec.\b The third function of augreality eye implants is to allow virtual teleconferencing. This is done by projecting a simulated model of each participant in the teleconferencing call into the field of vision of each other participant, wherever they may be, using the spatial model of the world provided by ARTek. Alternatively, when calling one-on-one, you can choose to be "transported" into the other person\'s location, whereupon the implants will replace your entire field of view with a reconstruction of their location from your perspective, also courtesy of ARTek.
Special Commands
This game has a few special commands. To use your augreality hud, for instance in order to pay someone, look up their identity, contact them, or connect to your cyberDec, simply type a command as if you are interacting with something in the world around you, and the hud will appear: PAY [someone], IDENTIFY [someone], CONNECT TO [cyberdec] or CALL [someone].

They took your arm. It was in the contract &emdash; fuck, you should've seen it coming. But somehow you hadn't thought it would ever come to this.\b
To get the warehouse job, you'd needed both arms agumented to keep up with the loading mechs. But you'd only been in the city for a couple of years, only managed to get your right arm and spine upgraded. Shit's expensive. So they made you a deal: they pay for the new iron, and you work the job at reduced wages to pay them off. If you left early, well, you didn't pay 'em back for the arm, so they'd take it as compensation.\b
If you'd had the slightest bit of choice, you wouldn't've given up the job, so you didn't think it would be an issue. It was good work. Clock in at 0700 every day, coordinate with the management AI, direct the loading mechs, deal with stuff too small or delicate for them to handle. It was work you could do, and it paid enough to get by, barely. That's all anyone can ask in the City. And it was so much better than the hellscape you'd escaped.\b
Then you'd been framed for theft of company property.\b
In a way, you're lucky that's what happened. You can hardly believe that, but that's the ugly truth. If you'd been the one to break the contract instead of them, they could've called in ICS and forced you back onto the job kicking and screaming if they wanted. Or had you accidentally beaten to death in the process.\b
Instead <i>they</i> were the ones that didn't want your sorry thieving prole ass in the production line, so why would they bother bringing you back? Instead they'd kicked you to the curb and ripped your arm off on the way down.\b
Fucking. Lucky.\b
This is...\n<h1>CIRCUITBOARD STREETS</h1>\nAn interactive cyberpunk novel by Alexis Purslane
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<blockquote><i>Welcome to the future\nAn always ice-cold nightmare\nBurnt coffee and Percocets\nThis night too will end...</i></blockquote>\n&ndash; Against Me, <i>Unconditional Love</i>\b
Now you're standing outside your apartment tower, trying to put the pieces of your life back together in your head. But they just aren't fitting. With something like this on your record, and a whole captive city to hire from, why would anyone hire you now? And without a job, how are you going to survive? Get food, shelter, the medicine you need? You need to get into your apartment and start exploring the 'net, looking for something, <i>anything.</i> \b
 You lean your forehead against your door, too shocked to process what's happening but already filled with dread.\b
<b>Chirp</b>. An augreal ping from the megablock's automated landlord pops into your field of vision. <i>Shit.</i> You know what this is now. Numbly, you mentally direct it to open. Sure enough.\b
'We regret to inform you,' it says in an empty female voice, 'that due to your recent theft and firing, your CI score has gone below acceptable levels. As per company policy, we have therefore canceled your lease. Your apartment will be reallocated, and all assets that are on company property are forfeit as of this moment.'\b
You want to scream. You want to shout and rail at the injustice of it, you want to slam your remaining fist into the door till it breaks &emdash; the door or your hand, it doesn't matter. By now you should be used to this fucking system. To the way the City works. Somehow you aren't. Somehow it still stings. Is that good? Does that mean you're not broken yet?\b
You stand still for a minute, eyes staring off into nothing, processing. Then something inside you snaps. There's nothing left to lose at this point. Your legal life is already over. And you're not going to let them take your last few possessions.\b
You look around with a mixture of relief and bitterness. This place has been your home for two years, and you just had to break in. Well, now it's time to grab anything useful and get the fuck out before anyone realizes what you've done. 
Suddenly, you hear the rising wail of sirens from somewhere outside the megablock. A moment later, you hear a staccato <i>whump</i> from around the building as all the other exits are closed off. They'll be waiting for you at the only exit now, calm and assured of their prey. You've been cornered. 
The rising wail of sirens, and then the spinning red and blue lights, are your first warnings that you're royally fucked. A moment later, a cop car pulls up beside the megablock entrance and two property enforcement officers step out. You're pinned. 
Far in the distance, you hear the wail of sirens as the police arrive to investigate what you did at the megablock. 
\bOutside your apartment, red alarm lights hidden in various places around the atrium, reserved for filtration failures and property crimes against the megablock's holding company, begin flashing neon red, and a constant, high pitched alarm starts to scream in your ears. <i>Clock's ticking,</i> you think to yourself. <i>Need to get the fuck out soon.</i>
The act of leaving the apartment tricks some internal alarm in the apartment's antideluvian logic system &emdash; someone just exited an apartment they never entered, and according to its finite state machine, that's an impossibility, a hole in the universe, and that means <i>crime</i>. Red warning holograms spring into existance clustered around your door and at various stations throughout the atrium like enraged moths, screaming in monospace capitals about breaking and entering and tresspass. <i>Clock's ticking,</i> you think to yourself. <i>Time to get the fuck out.</i>
As you walk away from the place that's been your home for the past two years, a strange feeling of unreality settles over you. You feel set adrift in deep, deep waters, and there is nowhere in the world you can return back to now, no fixed place to anchor you, to reassure you that it's always there, waiting for you at the end of every day. Your isolation in this City suddenly hits home with all the force of a sandbag to the head. You moved here to escape the very real dangers of where you'd grown up, to find safety and freedom and a marginally better life, and you <i>have</i> found that. You'd rather be isolated than dead. But still. A vast, empty chasm seems to have opened up around you, and inside you. There's no one to turn to for help, no friendly face to lend you their couch. You don't have anything but what you're cradling in your arms. 
Nanowire\'s offer
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<i>Devaluation reigns\nAnd fear of self-destruction\nAdapt or be replaced\nAnd follow their instructions...\n</i>\n&ndash; Essenger/Scandroid, <i>Empire of Steel</i>\b
Your priorities have been brutally paired down to the essentials by circumstance, the underpinnings of all animal existence laid bare for you in painful clarity. You only need two things right now: a job, so you can eat, and shelter.\b
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<i>So lay waste to all we've made\n For your corporate palisade\n You won't automate our roles\n If we digitize our souls\n A new force will intervene\n Half human, half machine\n And no enterprise on Earth will make us kneel\n To your empire of steel...</i>\b
With trepidation in your heart, you accept the contact Jason sends you. It is simple, practically empty, no previous history. A brand new cryptographically generated one-time anonymous handle, so that you can't trace who you're talking to. This is the big leages now.\b
You step into Nanowire's apartment with a strange feeling of fear and excitement running through your stomach in loops like electricity in a copper coil. Although you briefly played at anti-corporate punk when you first started living in the City, that quickly fell to the wayside when you couldn't find anyone like you. You had wanted to organize, find a union or something, things your dad had told you about the old days, like the union surge in the early '20s, but you had quickly found that it was every woman for themselves, the efficient logic of the corporate system expertly cutting people apart without even needing to pay special attention to doing so. Now, though... now you're stepping into that world again, and this time for real. No play-acting now. You've gone black. Off the edge.\b

Outside Megablock M-3B
The street here is dominated by the impossibly large black edifice of Megablock M-3B to the west, glistening in the eternal acid drizzle of the city. To the north, the apartment buildings and offices that surround the megablock like a crowd of ragged worshipers begin to give way to the more ambitious neo-Gothic architecture of the city's richer districts, while to the south, the buildings give way to a precariously leaning maze of slums that crashes up against the huge blocks of the warehouse district beyond like dirty surf. To the east, the warmth and light of the gray market shows like patches of mold on the collapsed ruins of another megablock, which is surrounded by a dilapitated chain-link fence.\b 
There is a glowing holographic cordon of moving black and yellow stripes around the entrance of the megablock, blocking off all passage while the property enforcement officers finish up their investigation &emdash; not that it'll be hard to figure out who broke into your apartment.
You start to go north toward the corporate district of the city, but, hearing sirens coming from that direction, you quickly turn back. No need to do the pigs' job for them. Better run the other way. 
The thought of venturing into the rich business district is too exhausting right now. You don't want to deal with the stares at your blue-collar attire and shabby cyberware, or seeing those corporate sons of bitches walking around with their briefcases and three-piece suits. It's sickening, and you've got bigger fish to fry right now. 
This part of the street stretches away for an interminably long time before it gets to anything interesting. It's much too far to walk. 
entrance; arched; door archway
The entrance to the megablock is a tall, pointed arch that leads into a dim interior. Instead of a door, the entrance is filled by a gently glowing orange filter-field, to keep the acidic air out, so that it's safe to take off your breathing apparatus inside.
The arched entrance to the megablock glows invitingly orange to your west.
advertisements; neon augreal VR virtual agumented reality; ads
These ads, floating in plots of space rented by various megacorporations from the feudal barons of the clearnet, and automatically overlaid onto your surroundings by your augmented reality enhanced eyes, which are in constant communication with the clearnet's rental databases, claim to provide a veritable cornucopia of distractions for the oxytocin and dopamine-addicted. From augreal partners displayed as gigantic etherial manniquens that stride and pose in the concrete parking lot in front of the megablock, to the billboards hawking nano-tailored nootropics and hallucinagens that wrap themselves around the length of the megablock itself, the area is a veritable profusion of ways to waste your hard earned cash.
A neon-bright skein of advertisements plays over everything, courtesy of the Megablock's generous sponsors.
megablock; m-3b, M-3B, black crumbling gigantic large edifice residency; tower skyscraper apartment building windows
The tower is the width and depth of a city block, and many hundreds of stories high judging by the lines of windows, an imposing finger of vertical planes and arches thrusting up at the gray-green sky. Here and there, clotheslines hang out of windows, usually hidden under makeshift awnings in a futile attempt to dry clothes. Every surface is covered in rubber-wrapped pipes and wires, which wrap around everything like ivy choking the life out of a tree, snaking downward toward the ground in patterns that seem almost logical &emdash; to an insane person.\bThe Megablock is the highest density, and therefore cheapest, living arrangement in the city. That is, unless you wanna end up in the slums. It's a chillingly apt monument to the brutality and utilitarian concerns of the new coporate world, a wonderfully efficient machine for holding warm bodies while they're not in use at factories and warehouses and offices. The people who live here are just barely managing to scrape by, and grateful for that.
pipes; rusty, snaking, plumming; tubes
The pipes that strangle the tower are ancient, and where visible through the eroded rubber, rusted and pitted. You can spot a few leaks here and there among the tangle, where fittings have loosened or been eroded away entirely. They are almost impossible to actually repair, however, because of their precarious position on the external walls of a tower several hundred stories high.
clothes; rotten, soot, gray, grey; clothing
A pitiful few articles of clothing. From this distance, it's difficult to see more.
window; ; windows
Thin, slitted windows with panes of cheap, inch-thick plastic covered with archaeological layers of scratches. A few here and there are lighted, and you can see people moving behind them.
