                        because it was divided up by 'and'/'or', I tried breaking it down into
                        smaller conditions, but that didn't work either. 'region is busy' was okay;
                        'the state entry is "busy"' was okay; 'the region is deserted' did not make
                        sense; 'the state entry is "deserted"' was okay; 'the region is at night'
