me: Thing 'you'
    "You glance down at yourself. You're a tall woman, muscular from a lifetime
    of habits formed when you were a kid working manual labor. You're wearing
    relatively simple clothes for the City, but still styled to keep up with the
    times: a pair of thick, heavy duty pants made of a material that looks like
    leather but breathes far better, an old faded yellow shirt, steel toed
    boots, and a micro-shell jacket with gold circuitry patterns thrown over top
    of everything against the cold."

    protection. As attested to by their worn, weathered leather and tended and
    scraped toes, you've owned these for many years and taken good care of them
    to make them last this long. You don't own any other pair of shoes."

     shoes, but really are some other sort of material that doesn't require an
     extinct animal to create and breathes well enough to be used for work.
     These are a recent purchase on your part, an attempt to fit into the
     City's neo-punk style better."

     wear in it for the sake of nostalgia — it's got a home-made print on it,
     of your favorite band from back home."

    "This jacket is made of a thin material that feels rough to the touch. It
     is near impenetrable by either cold or heat — and also bullets according
     to the ad-copy, which you don't believe for a second and have no
     intention of trying out — and yet somehow reasonably cool. A thin, almost
     tasteful circuitry pattern is embroidered around the coller and down the
     shoulders in gold thread. It's a recent purchase on your part, like your
     boots, an attempt to fit into the City's neo-punk style better, and you
     have no regrets."
