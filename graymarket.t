grayMarket: OutdoorRoom 'Mandible Block (entrance)'
    "An empty stretch of packed gray dirt, always slightly muddy from the perpetual drizzle, is bifurcated by a rusty, leaning chain-link fence here. On the west side of the fence, the packed dirt verges up against the City's central street, which runs north and south, across which is Megablock M-3B. On the east side, through a hole cut in the fence with a plasma torch, the packed dirt opens up on a gigantic lot, easily the size of several normal city blocks, on which lies the shattered bones of Megablock M-3C and, nestled within them like maggots infesting some paleolithic monster's shattered skull, the tents of the gray market."

    conciseDesc = "West is the the central city road, across which stands the megablock, towering imposingly like a blinded lighthouse. East, through a hole in a chain-link fence, is the central track that leads through the gray market."

+ fence: Decoration 'chain link fence; chain-link chain cut high rusted rusty leaning bent'
    "It's a high chain link fence, perhaps eight feet tall, lined with barbed wire at the top. Rust crusts over it here and there. A hole large enough to step through has been cut into it with a plasma touch, and a beaten track leads through that hole and into the gray market."

+ grayMarketTents: Distant 'gray market; black; tents tent maggots'
    "Tents of all sizes line the ruins to either side of the small track that snakes out from the hole in the fence, from small single-occupant tents with their sides opened to form a sort of stall defended from the drizzle, to huge house-sized affairs. Everything is lighted in a multitude of colors, a warm glow which does brave battle against the perpetual night's terrors. People bustle about inside and around the various tents, laughing, cheering, shouting, haggling, getting into fights, and generally milling about. For all its foreboding setting, this place feels startlingly <i>human</i>."

    "Hills of rubble, bent iron rods, and decaying construction equipment, giving way here and there to jutting walls, are all that remains of Better Housing Corp's hopes and dreams. This failed follow-up to the first two megablocks was what ultimately led to their bankrupcy, and the auction that landed Megablock M-3B in the hands of a Smile Corp subsidiary."
