Next to it, a cartoonish animation of a zombie emerging from a coffin floats in neon green and red. <<first time>><i>Maybe not the best marketing,</i> you think wryly.<<only>> Below this sign, a ribcage of metal tubes and support beams holding rows and rows of coffin boxes crouches like a gigantic fourty-legged spider against the clogged sky. This must be the Coffin Hotel itself, then. Around and behind the Coffin Hotel, hills of garbage pile up in every direction, pushing up in drifts like disgusting snow against the apartment buildings that surround this impromptu dump."

    "The strange, spindly, clutching structure is composed mostly of metal tubing, probably stolen construction scaffolding from Megablock M-3C up the road, but who knows. It's not like anyone here cares. The spider clutches two rows of twenty stacks of four vaguely-translucent white plastic boxes each, all held about four feet apart on every side, like carefully cradled eggs waiting to hatch. Between the two rows is a double-spine of reinforced steel beams wide enough apart to permit a rusty industrial lift on tanklike treds to move up and down the isles and lift customers up to their desired coffin."

You try to lie to yourself, convince your mind it isn't packed into a tiny box only a few feet bigger than itself, with little room to stretch and none to move, but it's impossible. The reality is staring you right in the face, undeniably, in the form of the coffin's translucent white lid and oppressive pale yellow interior lights, shining from LED strips around the lid. The interior of the coffin is padded on most sides in worn-down self-cleaning plastic-covered pillows, even up the walls, where two swells in the padding hide the casings for the lid's hydraulics. There is another, softer swell in the padding where your head should be, and, to your left, a small inset in the wall holds a yeast food synthesizer. A paper sign is taped above it."

coffinOwner: Actor 'coffin hotel owner; gray gaunt sickly metal metallic military; person implants scars studs woman; her' @coffinHotel
    "The coffin hotel owner is thin. Not just thin, but gaunt: cheeks sunken, hands bony talons, glistening dark eyes hooded, skin stretched over sharp, delicate, birdlike bones. Skin, you notice, that has a distinctly unsettling grayness to it, as if she were not quite... alive. Her dimunitive stature is exaggerated to the point of almost childlike smallness by her hunched shoulders and deeply curved spine. There is something striking about her face, too: it's thin and frail, with a deep dreamy melancholy etched into it, as if she can remember times when things were better, and prefers to spend her days in those memories, instead of in the dirty present. Two small oblong metal studs stick out of her forehead, the skin around them thickened with the scar tissue that's the telltale sign of early cybernetics. You can't remember having seen anything like these implants before in person, but you know from histories that they &emdash; or similar ones, anyway &emdash; were used by the military, for piloting drones and tanks.
